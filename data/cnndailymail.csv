92c514c913c0bdfe25341af9fd72b29db544099b,"Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee. 'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.","Experts question if  packed out planes are putting passengers at risk .

The Reds were linked with a move for the 25-year-old, whose contract expires in June, earlier in the season when Simon Mignolet was dropped from the side. A January move for Neto never materialised but the former Atletico Paranaense keeper looks certain to leave the Florence-based club in the summer. Neto rushes from his goal as Juan Iturbe bears down on him during Fiorentina's clash with Roma in March . Neto is wanted by a number of top European clubs including Liverpool and PSG, according to his agent . It had been reported that Neto had a verbal agreement to join Serie A champions Juventus at the end of the season but his agent has revealed no decision about his future has been made yet. And Castagna claims Neto will have his pick of top European clubs when the transfer window re-opens in the summer, including Brendan Rodgers' side. 'There are many European clubs interested in Neto, such as for example Liverpool and Paris Saint-Germain,' Stefano Castagna is quoted as saying by Gazzetta TV. Firoentina goalkeeper Neto saves at the feet of Tottenham midfielder Nacer Chadli in the Europa League . 'In Spain too there are clubs at the very top level who are tracking him. Real Madrid? We'll see. 'We have not made a definitive decision, but in any case he will not accept another loan move elsewhere.' Neto, who represented Brazil at the London 2012 Olympics but has not featured for the senior side, was warned against joining a club as a No 2 by national coach Dunga. Neto joined Fiorentina from Atletico Paranaense in 2011 and established himself as No1 in the last two seasons.","Fiorentina goalkeeper Neto has been linked with Liverpool and Arsenal .

3da746a7d9afcaa659088c8366ef6347fe6b53ea,"Bruce Jenner will break his silence in a two-hour interview with Diane Sawyer later this month. The former Olympian and reality TV star, 65, will speak in a 'far-ranging' interview with Sawyer for a special edition of '20/20' on Friday April 24, ABC News announced on Monday. The interview comes amid growing speculation about the father-of-six's transition to a woman, and follows closely behind his involvement in a deadly car crash in California in February. And while the Kardashian women are known for enjoying center stage, they will not be stealing Bruce's spotlight because they will be in Armenia when the interview airs, according to TMZ. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Bruce Jenner, pictured on 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians' will speak out in a 'far-ranging' interview with Diane Sawyer later this month, ABC News announced on Monday . Return: Diane Sawyer, who recently mourned the loss of her husband, will return to ABC for the interview . Rumors started swirling around Jenner's gender identity last year, when he emerged from a Beverly Hills clinic with his Adam's apple shaved down. His behavior over the past year also fueled speculation as he began embracing an increasingly female appearance, including growing out his hair, shaving his legs and painting his nails, while reportedly undergoing hormone therapy. He also split from with his wife of more than two decades, Kris Jenner, with whom he has two daughters, Kyle and Kendall. She filed for divorce in September 2014, citing 'irreconcilable differences'. Reports also emerged over the past week that he has received a breast enhancement. 'Bruce had silicone breast implants put in a few weeks ago,' a source told RadarOnline. 'He went with a smaller implant because he didn't want to look ridiculous.' On Sunday, he was seen walking to his car in Malibu but hid his body beneath a bulky sweatshirt. Out and about: Jenner was pictured walking back to his car in Malibu on the weekend and hiding beneath a large sweatshirt on Sunday, days after reports that he had undergone a breast enhancement . Hiding: He also apparently had painted his nails red when he was seen walking on Sunday . According to Radar, Jenner wants to have all surgeries completed in time to make his on-screen debut as a woman on the fall season of 'Dancing with the Stars'. Jenner is also rumored to be filming a spin-off docu-series about the transition on E!, although his reps have refused to confirm the claims. While Jenner himself has remained silent about his reported transition, some of his relatives, including step-daughter Kim Kardashian, have spoken about about his 'journey'. 'I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about,' Kim recently told Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way. I think everyone goes through things in life and I think that story and what Bruce is going through, I think he'll share whenever the time is right.' Jenner, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Olympics, also made headlines earlier this year for his involvement in a deadly car crash in Malibu. Deadly: In February, Jenner's vehicle, which was pulling a trailer and an ATV (seen right) rear-ended a woman's car (left) and pushed it into the lane of an oncoming Hummer. She died at the scene . By his side: Bruce, pictured with his ex-wife Kris Jenner and four of his step-children (from left) Rob, Kim, Kourtney and Khloe, has received support from his family. Kris filed for divorce from him last year . His Cadillac Escalade, which was pulling a trailer and off-road vehicle, plowed into the back of a Lexus and pushed it into the path of an oncoming Hummer on February 7. The Lexus was carrying 69-year-old Kim Howe, who died from chest trauma at the scene. Police sources say Jenner is unlikely to be prosecuted because he wasn't drinking, speeding or texting at the time of the fatal crash. His tell-all interview will also be one of Sawyer's first forays back to TV news following the death of her husband, acclaimed director Mike Nichols, following a heart attack last November. Last September, she left the anchor chair of ABC World News and announced that she planned to focus on specials. In February, she presented 'A Nation of Women Behind Bars', in which she went to prisons across the country to speak with female inmates.","Tell-all interview with the reality TV star, 69, will air on Friday April 24 .

The prize porker, known  as Pigwig, had fallen into the pool in an upmarket neighbourhood in Ringwood, Hampshire. His owners had been taking him for a walk around the garden when the animal plunged into the water and was unable to get out. A team from Dorset Fire and Rescue struggled to haul the huge black pig out of swimming pool water . The prize porker known as Pigwig had fallen into the water and had then been unable to get out again . Two fire crews and a specialist animal rescue team had to use slide boards and strops to haul the huge black pig from the small pool. A spokesman for Dorset Fire and Rescue Service said: 'At 4.50pm yesterday the service received a call to a pig stuck in a swimming pool. 'One crew of firefighters from Ferndown and a specialist animal rescue unit from Poole were mobilised to this incident. 'Once in attendance the crew secured the pig with strops, and requested the attendance of another appliance which was mobilised from Ringwood by our colleagues in Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service. Firefighters were also called out to a horse which had fallen into a swimming pool in Heyshott, West Sussex . The exhausted animal had to be winched to using an all-terrain crane but appeared no worse for wear after its tumble .

But Pigwig wasn't the only animal who needed rescuing after taking an unexpected swim . Crews in West Sussex were called out to a swimming pool where this time a horse had fallen in. Wet and very bedraggled, the exhausted animal put up no opposition when firefighters arrived to hoist her out of the small garden pool in Heyshott. The two-hour rescue operation ended with the wayward horse being fitted with straps under her belly and lifted up into the air with an all-terrain crane before being swung around and deposited back on dry land. A fire brigade spokesman said that she appeared none the worse for her impromptu swim after stepping over the edge of the domestic pool.","Giant pig fell into the swimming pool at his home in Ringwood, Hampshire .

6394f51b120ceb3da5e7b53dd5167fc4cf80b514,"The amount of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, the corporation’s boss has admitted. Figures show that while millions still tune in, they listen for much shorter bursts. The average listener spent just ten hours a week tuning in to BBC radio in the last three months of 2014, according to official figures. The length of time people spend listening to BBC radio has dropped to its lowest level ever, figures show . This was 14 per cent down on a decade earlier, when listeners clocked up an average of 11.6 hours a week. The minutes of the BBC Trust’s February meeting, published yesterday, revealed that director general Tony Hall highlighted the fall. ‘He noted…that time spent listening to BBC radio had dropped to its lowest ever level,’ the documents said. Sources blamed the downward trend on people leading faster-paced lives than in the past, and a change in habits amongst young people. Lord Tony Hall, BBC director general, highlighted the decline to the BBC Trust, according to minutes of its February meeting . Many people who used to listen to radio as a daily habit now turn to online streaming services such as Spotify for their music fix. That problem is likely to grow, as Apple develops its long-rumoured streaming service. A BBC spokesman said: ‘The number of people listening to BBC radio stations and audience appreciation levels are as high as ever. ‘But time spent listening has inevitably been affected by digital competition and as people ‘tune in’ in new, digital ways. ‘[Those ways] aren’t reflected in the traditional listening figures quoted here – like watching videos from radio shows or listening to podcasts.’ BBC radio is still reaching 65 per cent of the population each week, according to the last set of figures available from RAJAR, the organisation which measures radio audiences. But although that figure feels relatively healthy by today’s standards, it has none the less fallen by more over the last decade. In the final three months of 2004, 66 per cent of people in Britain listened to BBC network radio every week. Lord Hall also used the BBC Trust meeting to note the strong performance of BBC Radio 6, the digital music station which the Corporation had at one point been planning to scrap. ‘He reported that the recent RAJAR figures showed that 6Music had become the first digital-only station to reach two million listeners,’ the minutes said. Earlier this month, Matthew Postgate, the BBC’s chief technology officer, said the Corporation would adopt a new ‘digital first’ strategy, to help it target a new generation of users. He said the organisation needed to ‘learn lessons’ if they want to ‘compete with organisations that were born in the digital age’.","Figures show that while millions still tune in they listen for shorter bursts .

57f68638739c3a1de8d9922b389d6ded39977012,"At 11:20pm, former world champion Ken Doherty potted a final black and extinguished, for now, the dream of Reanne Evans to become the first women player to play the hallowed baize of Sheffield's Crucible Theatre in the world snooker championship. In every other respect however, 29-year-old Evans, a single mum from Dudley, was a winner on Thursday night. She advanced the cause of women in sport no end and gave Doherty the fright of his life in an enthralling and attritional match that won't be bettered in this year's qualifying tournament. Snooker's governing body had been criticised in some quarters for allowing Evans a wild card to compete alongside 127 male players for the right to play in the sport's blue-chip event on April 18 - something no female had achieved. Reanne Evans shakes hands with Ken Doherty following his 10-8 victory at Ponds Forge . Evans plays a shot during her world championship qualifying match against Doherty . Doherty, who won the World Championship title back in 1997, took out the first frame 71-15 . Evans had Doherty in all sorts of trouble before the former champion closed out the game 10-8 . Those critics and the bookies who made Doherty a ridiculously short-priced 20/1 on favourite were made to look foolish as Evans had her illustrious opponent on the ropes before finally bowing out 10-8. A gracious Doherty admitted afterwards: 'She played out of her skin. It was good match play snooker and tough all the way through. There was a lot of pressure on this match, a different kind of pressure to what I've ever experienced. 'I don't usually feel sympathy for my opponents but I felt sorry at the end. She played better than me and lost. I don't know how I won that final frame. If it had gone to 9-9, I'd have been a million-to-one to win it.' Evans, cheered on by her eight-year-old daughter Lauren at the Ponds Forge sports centre in Sheffield, admitted she was exhausted after a match of unfamiliar intensity for her. A 10-time ladies' champion, Evans had led twice during the opening session before Doherty went 5-4 in front . The 10-time ladies world champion collected just £400 as prize money for winning the title in 2013, and this was a completely different environment against a player who beat Stephen Hendry to be crowned the best player in the world in 1997. 'It was a struggle. With the experience Ken had, I just had to dig in,' she said. 'Ken had little runs when he needed it but I could tell he was under pressure. Some of the balls were wobbling in from the first frame. I just couldn't take advantage in the end. 'I can play better than I did so there is no reason I can't return and beat Ken or even players above him. I have the women's game on my shoulders. I just hope I get some help and am allowed to play in more big tournaments to give me experience. 'Next week, I will playing the ladies in the club again. It's a lovely club don't get me wrong but I don't think many ladies could give Ken a game. I think I would have won if I'd taken it to 9-9.' The presence of television crews and snooker star Ronnie O'Sullivan underlined what a big story Evans' participation was. Evans eyes up her move during an enthralling game with Doherty in Sheffield . She lost the first frame convincingly but the nerves didn't show after that. She reeled off three frames in a row, led 4-3 and once Doherty went in front, pegged him back to 5-5 and 6-6. The Irishman, now ranked No 46 in the world, started to look his 45 years. He sat down at every opportunity while Evans often stood while he played. She had the confidence to play right-handed or left-handed, as O'Sullivan sometimes does. The key frame was the sixteenth. It lasted 45 minutes with Evans rattling off the first 59 points and Doherty the next 74. It took Doherty to a 9-7 lead but Evans came roaring back in the next frame. He needed a snooker to avoid the match going into a final frame – and he got it. Doherty, now ranked No 46 in the world, showed his experience to close out the contest . He has two more qualifying rounds before he makes the Crucible but it's doubtful he will face a tougher opponent. 'They should let her play in more competitions,' he added. Evans should certainly use this match to become a leading ambassador for women's sport. Her purple and silver waistcoats drew admiring glances from the swimmers and trampolinists who turned up at the leisure centre as normal as she walked through reception to the basketball hall, where 10 snooker tables had been set up. Next time they will know exactly who she is, and what she can do.","Reanne Evans faced Ken Doherty in World Championship qualifier .

20778c35c19d741cc182719de336d71e1a0b228e,"A gang of six men have been jailed for a total of 31 years after being convicted of a string of sexual offences against teenager girls. The offences, which ranged from inciting sexual activity with a child, to rape, happened in cars, woods or at the defendants' homes in Banbury, Oxfordshire. Oxford Crown Court heard how they lured victims to parties organised on social media and then began sexually abusing them. The men were found guilty in March and have now been handed sentences of between three and nine years in jail. Jailed: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21 (left) was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, (right) was imprisoned for four years and nine months . The girls, aged between 13 and 16, were targeted by the gang  at under-18s parties organised by Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, known as 'Fiddy'. One child described the parties as 'a place where girls would go and the boys would choose their targets'. The victims, who were described in court as 'emotionally immature' were abused from 2009 to 2014. Sentencing Hassan-Sule and the others in a court packed with friends and relatives of the defendants and victims yesterday, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You put on charity events to raise money for your football club. 'This raised your profile among young people in Banbury and you saw yourself as a celebrity. 'Your friends helped put on these events and you became a sexually promiscuous group, not with your own girlfriends, but with girls who were young, vulnerable and lacking in maturity.' The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence, who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag'. Behind bars: Kagiso Manase, 26, (left) was jailed for four years and Said Saleh, 20, (right) was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute . One of the victims told the Oxford Mail: 'When I used to go missing I would swear at my mum and I didn't realise I was being really nasty to her. The men put me against my family – it was really clever. When I started hanging around with them I felt important. 'I had no friends and they were the only people left to talk to. It was a big part of my life and I was scared. I felt like all my friends were making new memories and I wasn't part of them. 'Calling people ""slags"" as the defence did in this case stops other girls from coming forward. I would say to other girls to think about the future. I never wanted to do it. I never wanted to have sex with them but I thought that's what friends did.' Thames Valley Police launched Operation Reportage after receiving a tip-off about the men's activities and eventually tracked down numerous teenager girls who had been molested. Detective Inspector Steve Raffield from Banbury Force CID said: 'This result would not have been possible without the bravery of the victims. 'I would like to thank them for coming forward and giving evidence in this case. As in all trials without their testimony we would not be where we are today. 'As a result young people will be safeguarded while these men will have time to reflect upon their actions in prison.' Convicted: Takudzwa Hova, 21, (left) was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, while Zsolt Szalontai, 18, (right) was sentenced to three years' detention in a Young Offenders' Institute after being found guilty of rape . Justice: The judge rejected the argument put forward by the defence at Oxford Crown Court (pictured), who accused the girls of coming forward because 'it's better to be a victim than a slag' Those jailed on Friday afternoon at Oxford Crown Court were: Ahmed Hassan-Sule, 21, of Banbury, who was found guilty of 13 counts of sexual activity with a child and one count of assault by penetration. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment. Mohamed Saleh, 22, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years and nine months' imprisonment. Said Saleh, 20, from Banbury, was found guilty of one count of sexual activity with a child. He was sentenced to four years' detention in a Young Offenders Institute.

Kagiso Manase, 26, of Banbury, was found guilty of two counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity and one count of sexual assault.

Tunisian skipper Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, was arrested when he stepped onto Sicilian soil last night, some 24 hours after his  boat capsized in the Mediterranean. Before leaving the Italian coastguard vessel, however, he was forced to watch the bodies of 24 victims of the tragedy being carried off the ship for burial on the island of Malta. He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration. Prosecutors claim he contributed to the disaster by mistakenly ramming the overcrowded fishing boat into a merchant ship that had come to its rescue. As a result of the collision, the migrants shifted position on the boat, which was already off balance, causing it to overturn. Scroll down for videos .

Both men were to be put before a judge later today. Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added. 'We have not yet been able to ask them about this but it seems certain that many of them will have had friends and family who were lost in the wreck.' Deep in thought: Malek stares in space while waiting to leave the rescue vessel. Survivors told how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya . They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday. Victims: Malek watches some of the bodies being taken off the rescue ship for burial in Malta . Grim: Survivors said they resorted to clinging to floating corpses until coastguards came to their rescue . Relaxed: Malek grins on the desk of the Italian coastguard ship next to some of the migrant survivors . Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths. Hardline: Tony Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said harsh measures are the only way to stop deaths . Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide. 'We have what is fast becoming a failed state on our doorsteps and criminal gangs are enjoying a heyday.' He estimated smugglers behind the doomed voyage from Libya to Europe would have made between €1million and €5million from selling desperate refugees spaces on the boat.","Mohammed Ali Malek, 27, has been charged with multiple manslaughter .

Last week South Korean prosecutors formally charged Kim Ki-Jong with attempted murder . The prosecutors' office in Seoul said Kim, was charged with attempted murder, violence against a foreign envoy and obstruction of duty. Kim, 55, was a known maverick activist who had been handed a two-year suspended sentence in 2010 for hurling a rock at the then Japanese ambassador to Seoul. He has denied any intention to kill Lippert, but the prosecutors office said in a statement that the crime was clearly deliberate. 'There was an intention to murder because (Kim) used a lethal weapon in a pre-meditated crime to attack the ambassador's face and neck repeatedly,' it said. Kim has told investigators the ambassador was the 'symbolic' target of his opposition to annual US-South Korea joint military exercises, which he blames for blocking dialogue with North Korea. The annual drills have long been condemned by Pyongyang as rehearsals for invasion. Kim insisted he had acted alone and not on the orders of Pyongyang, but prosecutors said they were looking into whether he has violated the South's strict National Security Law banning any act seen as aiding North Korea or promoting its ideology. Investigators have ransacked Kim's home as part of an investigation into Kim's possible links with North Korea. Kim had visited the North seven times and once tried to erect a memorial in Seoul to the late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il after his death in 2011.

391b4610e3a9dcefd61e428155cc5afb2683124c,"(CNN)Warren Weinstein, who appears to have been the only American citizen held hostage by al Qaeda, was accidentally killed in a U.S. drone strike in January. But it didn't have to be that way. A senior U.S. official familiar with the handling of the issue told CNN that the U.S. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert's release, either directly to al Qaeda or through proxies in Pakistan. Another senior U.S. official told CNN that Weinstein's capture by al Qaeda made it hard for the United States to negotiate, even though proxies such as the Pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped. A senior Pakistani official told CNN that after Weinstein was kidnapped, the Pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant Haqqani Network and to the Pakistani Taliban, which are both allied to al Qaeda, to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about Weinstein. According to the official, nothing came of those feelers. The senior Pakistani official says that during the past year Pakistani soldiers, who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of North Waziristan near the Afghan-Pakistan border where Weinstein was believed to be being held, went door-to-door looking for the American. Nothing came of this search either. On Thursday, the U.S. government announced that Weinstein had been killed in a ""counterterrorism operation"" in January, which is how the government often describes CIA drone strikes. According to New America, which tracks drone strikes in Pakistan, CIA drone attacks happened in Shawal, North Waziristan, on January 19 in which at least four militants were killed; also on January 15 in Tehsil Ladha, South Waziristan, in which at least five militants were killed; and on January 4 in Datta Khel, South Waziristan, in which at least eight militants were killed. It is in one of these strikes that Weinstein was almost certainly killed. Lt. Col. Jason Amerine, a planner on the U.S. Army staff, is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter's office, which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of American hostages held by al Qaeda and the Taliban. A plan was developed in the Pentagon to secure the release of Weinstein, according to a staff member on Hunter's committee. That plan was to release Haji Bashir Noorzai, a prominent and influential member of the Taliban who is in prison in the States on drug trafficking charges, in exchange for U.S. Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal, who was held by the Taliban until last year; Taliban hostages Caitlin Coleman, a U.S. citizen, and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle; and Dr. Shakil Afridi, who spied for the CIA in Pakistan and was being held in a Pakistani prison, as well as Weinstein. It's not clear how far this plan of action went. Amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure. Hunter, a California Republican, released a statement Thursday, saying, ""The only government organization seriously developing options to recover Weinstein and others in the Afghanistan/Pakistan region was within the Pentagon -- led by war hero Jason Amerine."" As an Army captain, Amerine led a small detachment of U.S. Special Forces into Afghanistan in November 2001 in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States. The operation was instrumental in helping to topple the Taliban and to install Hamid Karzai as the new leader of Afghanistan. Who exactly carried out Weinstein's kidnapping from his house 3½  years ago in the Pakistani megacity of Lahore has until now not been clear. A senior Pakistani counterterrorism official told CNN that members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, kidnapped Weinstein at his Lahore home on August 13, 2011. IMU is an Uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of Pakistan along its border with Afghanistan. According to the Pakistani official, the leader of the Weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of Tahir Yuldashev, the former IMU leader killed in a CIA drone strike in the Pakistani tribal regions in 2009. The initial lead that traced the Weinstein kidnapping to the IMU came from another high-profile kidnapping in Pakistan two weeks after Weinstein's abduction. Shahbaz Taseer, the son of a leading Pakistani liberal politician Salman Taseer -- who was killed by Pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in Lahore on August 26, 2011. At the scene of Taseer's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and SIM card that eventually led Pakistani officials to focus on the IMU group in Lahore, according to the senior Pakistani counterterrorism official. The police subsequently arrested three Uzbeks and four Pakistanis who were part of the IMU cell that had carried out the Weinstein kidnapping. Members of the IMU cell told Pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped Weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in Lahore. IMU members then took Weinstein to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan, a semi-autonomous region along the border with Afghanistan where al Qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered. There Weinstein was given or, more likely, sold to al Qaeda, according to the senior Pakistani official. Who was Warren Weinstein? Weinstein had spent his life helping others, working in the fields of aid and development. He held a doctorate in international law and economics from Columbia University and spoke more than half a dozen languages. After his capture, the leader of al Qaeda, Ayman al-Zawahiri, demanded the end of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan and the release of terrorists held in U.S. custody in exchange for Weinstein's freedom. On September 12, 2012, Weinstein appeared in a video produced by al Qaeda's production arm in which he said that the Obama administration had shown ""no interest in my case."" He then appealed to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from ""one Jew to another"" to intervene. The Obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy, which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by ISIS, al Qaeda or the Taliban. The key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the U.S. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them. The CIA, for instance, is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations, while the FBI has responsibility for retrieving American hostages. Often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with Weinstein. The CIA could have exercised more due diligence knowing that Weinstein was almost certainly being held in North Waziristan. There are some solutions for these problems. First, families should be granted security clearances by the U.S. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones. Right now, the U.S. government won't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives don't have the requisite security clearances. Should families abuse their clearances, they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones, which is a strong incentive not to abuse them. Second, President Barack Obama should appoint a senior-level person, perhaps working in the White House on the National Security Council, to oversee the work of the CIA, FBI, State Department and the Joint Special Operations Command, which implements hostage rescues. All these organizations have key roles to play in getting American hostages home. That person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and ""de-conflict"" any potential issues, such as the ones that surfaced in the Weinstein case. Third, while the U.S. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups, there is nothing in American policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of U.S. citizens, and this should be encouraged, even if there is some quid pro quo involved. This is what happened in the case of the American journalist Peter Theo Curtis, who was captured by al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria in 2012, but was released last year after the Qatari government intervened in his case. The Qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in Syria, including the al Qaeda affiliate holding Curtis, and while Qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free Curtis, it's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al Qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys. Curtis' successful release could provide a ray of hope for U.S. citizen Caitlin Coleman and her husband, Canadian Joshua Boyle, who were captured by the Taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through Afghanistan. A senior American official told CNN they are being held by the Haqqani Network. The Pakistani government has contacts with the Haqqani Network, and the U.S. government should ratchet up the pressure on the Pakistani government to secure the couple's release. In captivity, Coleman, who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage, had a child. The name of the child is unknown.","U.S. hostage Warren Weinstein is believed to have been accidentally killed in counter-terrorism strike .

Argentinian con-artist Sofia Davila posted raunchy pictures or herself online and then flirted with unsuspecting men she had contacted on the social network, suggesting they meet up for sex. But after meeting her victims, the 21-year-old from Buenos Aires, would spike their drinks and wait for them to fall unconscious, before ransacking their homes. Buenos Aires thief Sofia Davila, 21, would start chatting to men over Facebook before suggesting that they meet up. When they did, she would spike their drinks and rob their homes after they fell unconscious . The 21-year-old posted raunchy pictures of herself on Facebook and flirt with strangers she added on the network. She was caught after trying to trick police that she was an innocent bystanders in the robberies . Diego Escalante, from Tigre, Buenos Aires, said he had been robbed after falling victim to the ploy. The 39-year-old said: 'We had been flirting with each other for about two weeks and then she suggested we get together. 'We went to a hotel and had a good time and when she suggested we meet again I didn't think anything was suspicious. 'The next time we met she came to my place and said she'd like to drink her own alcohol and poured me one too. I then began to fill ill and passed out. 'When I woke up my feet and hands were tied and there were two men in my flat taking my TV, stereo and other things.' After carrying out the ruse Davila went to the police station herself to report the robbery - claiming she had been forced to leave the flat by the men, and had been powerless to stop them. The thief has been nicknamed the 'Black Widow of Facebook'. She is now awaiting trial after admitting tricking 15 men and robbing them. Two of her accomplices will also appear in court over the crimes . But a spokesman for the police said they were suspicious, having received numerous calls from men who had been stolen from after they spent the night with a woman they met over the internet . He said: 'The problem with her statement was that we had already received a dozen complaints from other men saying they had been robbed after meeting a woman over Facebook. 'This was the first time the woman had actually shown up herself though, but because she matched the description we already had we decided to hold her for questioning. One of Davila's victims said the pair hit it off at a hotel, and he didn't think have any suspicions when they met up again at his home. He said she drugged him and he woke up with his feet tied and two men stealing his TV . 'As soon as we spoke to the victim we knew she was the woman behind the robberies and it only took a little while before we had a full confession. We also found that the man had been drugged.' Davila admitted to bedding and robbing more than 15 men and is now awaiting trial along with her two accomplices.

Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performing companies by The 2015 Australian Fashion Report. Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara. The report assessed the labour rights management systems of 59 companies and 219 brands operating in Australia. The 2015 Australian Fashion Report has named and shamed some of the worst Aussie clothing brands and companies for their ongoing exploitation of overseas workers . Amongst the best performers were Etiko, Audrey Blue, Cotton On, H&M and Zara . It found that only two of the companies could prove they were paying a full living wage to the workers in two of the three production stages of their clothing. None of the 59 companies could prove the workers at their raw material suppliers were paid a living wage. Unlike a country's legally set minimum wage, a living wage ensures that an employee has enough money to cover the necessities - like food, water, electricity and shelter - and still has a little left over for themselves and their dependants. In some countries like Bangladesh, where the minimum wage is as little as US$68 a month and a living wage is US$104, the difference can be made by paying each worker just an additional 30c per t-shirt. Lowes, Industrie, Best & Less and the Just Group - which includes Just Jeans, Portmans and Dotti - were identified as some of the worst performers . 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid, said . 'A mere 12 per cent of companies could demonstrate any action towards paying wages above the legal minimum, and even then, only for part of their supply chain,' the report states. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs. 'If companies don't know how and where their products are made, then there's no way for them to ensure that their workers are protected.' Uzbekistan for instance, the world's fifth largest exporter of cotton, was notorious for its  child labour policies which saw children as young as 10 forced to work in the fields until the government recently  improved conditions by renouncing the use of child labour 'on a systematic basis'. 'Furthermore, 91 per cent of companies still don't know where all their cotton comes from and 75 per cent don't know the source of all their fabrics and inputs,' the report stated . Gershon Nimbalker, an advocacy manager at Baptist World Aid told Daily Mail Australia that part of the motivation behind the report was to shed light on how many of the world's 165 million children involved in child labour were employed by the fashion industry. 'The whole point in our reporting scorecard is if these companies don't have rigours systems in place to mitigate against those risks then you can't be sure that there is no forced labour or child labour in their supply chain,' he said. 'There were 61 assessment criteria that we used to grade the companies that were put together with lots of collaboration with international labour rights organisations. 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. The report comes almost two years after over 1,100 Bangladeshi garment workers died when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed in Bangladesh due to building safety problems . 'We found all the public information available on the companies - public statements, anything online - and compiled and assessed it before sending a copy to the company and asking for feedback or asking them to tell us what we missed. 'The worst grades basically mean that they have very little public information available about what they're doing to protect workers and on top of that that they haven't engaged with our research process. About 75 per cent did engage, but one quarter didn't.' However the report also noted some progress in the industry with companies like Kmart and Cotton On improving their transparency by identifying their suppliers, and H&M, Zara, Country Road and the Sussan Group showing attempts to improve their international worker's pay.","Australian Fashion Report revealed the Australian-sold brands and companies that ignore the exploitation of their overseas workers .

A courageous shopkeeper was killed when he made a desperate attempt to stop a gang of thieves who had broken into his van in a cash and carry car park. Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam ran and jumped through an open side door of their van, but was pushed out and hit the ground as the vehicle sped away. A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a ‘nasty crunch’ as the 34-year-old’s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was ‘a few cheap packets of cigarettes’. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: ‘Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. ‘With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. ‘Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.’ A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna’s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O’Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr Prasanna . ‘He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. He wanted no more than a few cheap packets of cigarettes,’ he said. Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: ‘Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. ‘I can’t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? “ . ‘You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.’ McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes. At an earlier hearing he pleaded not guilty to murder and not guilty to conspiracy to rob. His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O’Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich. On the Sunday they drove to Radwell and collected McInerney. The Costco in Watford where three men - cousins Patrick and James O’Driscoll and Michael McInerney - tried to grab cigarettes from Mr Prasanna's van before speeding off in separate vehicles. All have now been jailed . In two vans they went to three sites, where they stole or attempted to steal from customers at Bookers in Bedford and Luton and at PC World at the Staples Retail Park in Hendon, before going to Costco in Watford. Mr Prasanna died on June 6 2013 in St Mary’s Hospital in London, 11 days after the attack on him. He came to England from Sri Lanka in 1998 and worked for Tesco as a manager. Mr Prasanna later opened his own shop in Basingstoke, Hampshire, with his younger brother Uday. They opened another store in Sittingbourne, Kent, and were looking at starting a third Southampton. Four years ago he married Shayanthy, 30, and the couple lived in Grandfield Avenue, Watford with their young son.","Prasanna Arulchelvam leapt into van as it sped away but was pushed out .

He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport. The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia. ""The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from,"" Durken said. The fires were started in southeastern Siberia, by farmers burning grass in their fields. But on April 14, it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region, according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV. As a result, the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region. Rescue crews were able to put out the flames. However, the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds. The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest. Parts of Oregon, Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke, wind and solar light combination. The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens, blues, yellows and purples, KOMO-TV said. That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered. The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person's eye. As the smoke starts to dissipate, air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue.","Smoke from massive fires in Siberia created fiery sunsets in the Pacific Northwest .

They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683. In a country where cows dominate the rural landscape, the discovery in an Austrian cellar shocked scientists. The researchers described it as a 'sunken ship in the desert'. Archaeologists have uncovered the complete skeleton of an 'alien' 17th-century camel that was likely used in the second Ottoman-Habsburg war. They believe the camel - the first intact camel skeleton found in central Europe - may have been left in the town of Tulln for trading after the siege of Vienna in 1683 . Genetic analysis of the beast show that it was a Bactrian-dromedary hybrid – a breed popular in the Ottoman army at the time. 'The partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle,' said Alfred Galik, a researcher at the University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna. 'But one look at the cervical vertebrae, the lower jaw and the metacarpal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel.' The camel was male, around seven years old and most likely castrated.

'Ours are treasures unheard of... tents, sheep, cattle and no small number of camels... it is victory as nobody ever knew before.' Galik and his team also said the cross-breed camel had been most likely used as a riding and transport animal by the Ottoman army during the Siege of Vienna in 1683. The remarkable find was made during an archaeological dig that took place amid preparations for a new shopping centre in the town. If modern-day scientists were stumped by the find, it would have been an even greater shock for residents of 17th-century Tulln. 'The animal was certainly exotic for the people of Tulln. They probably didn't know what to feed it or whether one could eat it,' Galik said. While Roman-era camel bones occasionally surface in Austria, Serbia and Belgium, the Tulln discovery was the first complete camel skeleton to emerge in Central Europe.

75fdaee82f6d0545a86b9d28b947186ce4b2a088,"(CNN)Would you want a TV program about your family history to include details of a distant, long-deceased relative who had owned slaves? Seriously, who in their right mind would want to be tarnished by the sins of an ancestor you had no connection to other than a remote bloodline? I wouldn't, and neither did Ben Affleck, who lobbied producers of a PBS show, ""Finding Your Roots,"" to remove any reference to his great-great-great grandfather Benjamin Cole, a Georgia slave owner in the mid-1800's, in an episode that looked at Affleck's family history. (Affleck revealed Cole's name Wednesday night.) Here's the thing that might surprise many, given the tendency of the media to exploit any potentially scandalous material: The show's producer, Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., apparently acquiesced to Affleck's request, because when the episode aired in October 2014, there was no mention of the star's slave-owning ancestor. Affleck's attempt to alter the content of the program only publicly became known a few days ago after WikiLeaks released hacked emails revealing an exchange between Gates and Sony Pictures chief Michael Lynton. When Gates asked how he should respond to Affleck's request to delete the material, Lynton responded, ""all things being equal, I would definitely take it out."" And on Tuesday, Affleck, via Facebook, admitted that he had urged Gates to excise any reference to his slave-owning relative. Affleck explained, ""I didn't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves. I was embarrassed. The very thought left a bad taste in my mouth."" Now Gates has publicly denied that he made his decision about the content of the program based on Affleck's request, but it seems likely that he did. After all, Affleck noted as much in his Facebook post, writing that Gates ""agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices I disagreed with."" And three other celebrities profiled on the series last season were shown to have been related to slave owners. So it's unlikely that it was simply happenstance that it left out any reference to Affleck's familial slave ownership connection. In any event, PBS has launched an internal review to determine if the show violated its own editorial standards. Whatever the results of the review, Affleck and Gates did the right thing. Let's be clear: ""Finding Your Roots"" is not an investigative news show; it's an entertainment program. In fact, as Affleck noted, much of the material is provided directly by the celebrity being profiled. It's not ""60 Minutes"" but more in the nature of a sophisticated profile of celebrities, using their marquee names to attract viewers. There's not even a hint that Affleck strong-armed the producers or made any type of threats against them if they included the information. In the emails between Gates and Lynton, which they presumably believed at the time were confidential and would remain so, there was no mention of undue pressure by Affleck. Instead, Gates simply noted that Affleck  ""asked us to edit out something."" After the emails were revealed, Gates issued a statement, saying, ""Ultimately, I maintain editorial control on all of my projects and, with my producers, decide what will make for the most compelling program. In the case of Mr. Affleck we focused on what we felt were the most interesting aspects of his ancestry -- including a Revolutionary War ancestor, a third great-grandfather who was an occult enthusiast, and his mother who marched for civil rights during the Freedom Summer of 1964."" My view would be different if Affleck had a history of uttering racist remarks or engaging in racist conduct. That would have made the information truly newsworthy. But instead we have a man known for championing progressive causes, which I'm sure made him even more acutely sensitive that some on the right might possibly use this information against him in the future. Perhaps that's what Affleck meant in his Facebook post when he wrote that this information made him feel ""vulnerable."" Affleck has noted that he regrets asking PBS to not include information about his ""distant relative.""  That's a nice gesture, but it was not needed. Affleck had every right to ask for the information about a long-deceased distant relative to be left out of the show. And PBS had the choice to include it or leave it out. I applaud PBS for doing the right thing at a time when media outlets rarely show any restraint on the lives of people in the public eye.","Ben Affleck admits he asked PBS show ""Finding Your Roots"" to avoid mentioning his slave-owning ancestor .

42482902d939b1d1e1182a58a5b313fde9b8484f,"Wanted: A police e-fit image of millionaire people trafficker Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72m with his accomplice Mered Medhanie from smuggling migrants in the last two years . Two millionaire people traffickers have been heard mocking the migrant boat disasters that have resulted in thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean, it has been reported. One of them, an Eritrean called Mered Medhanie, also known as The General, was heard laughing on a police wiretap about overloading migrant ships, a problem that causes them to capsize. Medhanie, 34, who is based in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, is said to have boasted: 'They say I put too many aboard, but they're the ones who want to leave in a hurry.' A second trafficker, Ermias Ghermay, who is thought to have made £72million with Medhanie from smuggling in the last two years, also showed callous disregard for the plight of his 'customers'. He was heard declaring last summer: 'They organised another trip a few days ago. I don't know what happened – they probably died.' Ghermay, who also lives in Tripoli, was already wanted on an arrest warrant in connection with an October 2013 capsizing off Lampedusa that left 366 dead. Reports of the conversations come just days after at least 900 people were feared to have drowned in one of the worst maritime disasters since the end of World War Two. More than 1,700 have perished in the last week alone. Italian police yesterday released Ghermay's photofit as they sought to track down the pair, who are among several traffickers wanted in connection with a major human smuggling ring. Ghermay and Medhanie are currently living undisturbed in Tripoli, exploiting the lawlessness in the collapse state which has allowed smugglers to operate with impunity since the fall of Gaddafi. Medhanie, who reportedly compares himself to the former Libyan dictator, and his accomplice enjoy the protection of local law authorities in the capital after it was taken over by a rival Islamist faction. A Italian naval officer stands in front of rescued migrants on board the Italian Navy vessel Bettica as they arrive in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta after being the latest group to be rescued from the Mediterranean . Terrified: Boys embrace as they arrive with migrants at the Sicilian harbor of Augusta with the Italian navy . In another wire tap recording, Medhanie, who is thought to have a wife and child in Sweden, is heard expressing scant regard for migrant suffering. 'We do an illegal job – but what do you expect? We're not the government,' he says, according to La Stampa as reported by The Independent. Others reveal how his business is booming, with him heard to say: 'This year I've done well – I sent off 7,000 to 8,000.' Another intercept reveals a discussion between Medhanie and his accomplices in Italy about the possibility of setting up bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, but opting for U.S. or Canadian banks because 'they don't ask you where the money comes from.' Safe: European governments came under increasing pressure to tackle the Mediterranean's migrant crisis ahead of a summit as harrowing details emerged of the fate of hundreds who died over the weekend . Rescued migrants wait to disembark from the Italian Navy vessel Bettica  in the Sicilian harbour of Augusta . Barbaric human traffickers are separating migrants by race, locking those with the darkest skin below deck where death is inevitable if the boat sinks, survivors have told. Teenagers arriving on the Italian island of Lampedusa told how passengers from sub-Saharan Africa were placed in the hold with no water, sunlight or, crucially, means of escape. One boy from Somalia told aid workers from Save The Children: 'The Libyans who got me to Italy are not human. 'They pushed eight Nigerians into the sea. They all drowned.' Conversely, Yusuf, a 17-year-old Palestinian boy who fled Gaza for Italy in February, said he was placed on an upper level with other people from the Middle East, it was reported by The Independent. Police in Palermo arrested 15 people on Monday in connection with a smuggling ring they say was masterminded by Ghermay. Prosecutors say the network had generated transactions worth hundreds of thousands of euros criss-crossing Europe as migrants paid not only to cross the Mediterranean but also to join relatives in northern Europe. Prosecutor Maurizio Scalia said based on telephone intercepts, the average cost to smuggle a migrant from Eritrea or Ethiopia to Libya ran $4,000 to $5,000, while the crossing to Italy cost an additional $1,000 to $1,500. Migrants pay hundreds of dollars more to get out of holding centers and at least another $1,000 to travel to northern Europe. Payments for each leg are made up front, often using the Islamic hawala banking system which is based on an informal honour code in which a relative in northern Europe pays a local broker. The payment information is then transmitted to the actual traffickers on the ground advising them that the leg has been paid for. European governments were today under mounting pressure to act decisively on the Mediterranean migrant crisis as harrowing details emerged of the fate of those who died in the worst tragedy to date. With the crisis set to be discussed at an emergency summit on Thursday, allegations of callous disregard for Arab and African lives are pushing EU leaders to respond to a disaster in which 800 people are feared to have died in appalling circumstances off the coast of Libya on Sunday.

The vast majority of those on board were locked in the hold or the middle deck of the 20-metre (66-foot) boat when it capsized following a collision with a Portuguese cargo ship responding to its distress signal. Only 28, including two crew members who have been arrested, survived and 24 bodies have been recovered. Survivors have described the moment the doomed ship sank, telling how how they clung to dead bodies in the pitch black sea in order to stay afloat. They also accused the captain of being drunk moments before he rammed another ship, causing the tragedy. Bangladeshi Riajul Islam, 17, said the only reason he survived was because he was on the top deck and knew how to swim. Nasir Khan, a fellow 17-year-old Bangladeshi, said he was also on the top deck and lived by clinging on to a life vest. The stricken boat initially set off from Egypt and then stopped off on the Libyan coast near the city Zuwarah to pick up more passengers, it has been reported. It set off from Libya on Saturday and sent out a distress signal shortly before midnight 120 miles south of the Italian island of Lampedusa. It later capsized.","Mered Medhanie and Ermias Ghermay 'have made £72m in last two years'

But yesterday the underemployed 26-year-old was spotted enjoying the high life in an overseas location yet again, this time at the Bahrain Grand Prix . She was in the Gulf state, ruled by a controversial king whose regime has been accused of violently repressing pro-democracy activists, with her long-term boyfriend Dave Clark, according to an onlooker who saw her among dignitaries on the starting grid before the race. ‘She was walking behind the Crown Prince of Bahrain. She was introduced to the recently abdicated King Carlos of Spain and curtseyed,’ the source said. ‘Bernie Ecclestone was leading that group of dignitaries.

8cbab1e00c52ae5b6405e221fc0eefeae00e3454,"After nearly two years of jockeying with Congress over the IRS's history of discriminating against conservative nonprofit groups, former official Lois Lerner won't be charged with a crime for defying a congressional subpoena and refusing to answer questions. U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ'S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I'LL TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions – a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to ""testimony"" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS’ actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama’s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated – but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner – and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal – was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS’s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said.

""This is a problem that is off the charts historically,"" he said, referring to the more than 20,000 foreign fighters who have gone into Syria. ""Just put that into perspective: It's about twice the number that went into Afghanistan in the 1980s over a 10-year period to fight the Soviet Union, and those came really from only a handful of countries."" He concluded, ""We're in unchartered territory here."" McGurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in Jordan. Last week, Canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against ISIS over Syria. The United States now lists 62 countries in the coalition. As the U.S.-led coalition has focused attention on Iraq and Syria, ISIS has expanded its reach to Libya, Egypt and Yemen, often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants. McGurk did not rule out expanding U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria to combat the increasing regional threat. ""We have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests, some of which are military tools,"" he said. ""Of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do."" The United States has also been stepping up efforts to involve Sunni groups in the fight against ISIS. To date, that involvement has been extremely limited as Sunni tribes see Shiite militias, many with horrendous human rights records, take the lead. But McGurk said that Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi is making progress getting Sunni tribes to support a planned Iraqi offensive against ISIS in Anbar province in the coming weeks. He stressed the importance of working with al-Abadi, noting that the Iraqi leader was in Anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 AK-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the Iraqi security forces. ""We are helping to enable and train (them) as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in Anbar,"" McGurk said. ""They put out this very perverse, twisted vision, and it's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world,"" he acknowledged. ""But in fact, what the foreign fighters are finding in Syria and Iraq is that they're more likely to get killed in Iraq and Syria, and in fact, instead of getting a slave bride as ISIS leaders promise them, they're more likely to get killed by a female Peshmerga fighter in the streets of Kobani."" That bottom line, he assessed, could turn the tide: ""The foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate, and I think we're going to see those networks begin to dry up.""","Obama's point man in ISIS fight doesn't rule out U.S. military action beyond Iraq and Syria .

He’s also lost a lot of weight, he’s going out jogging.’ Asked if he thought Mr Cameron was too vain, Mr Farage said: ‘To a certain extent they all are. Some people it worries to death and others really don’t worry too much.’ Mr Cameron, 48, has previously been accused of visiting stylists and even trichologists to keep his hair looking youthful. In 2011, Downing Street was forced to deny claims Mr Cameron was fighting the relentless process with unnatural help after his grey hairs looked less prominent, . ‘I promise you he has not dyed his hair,’ a spokesman said. ‘The Prime Minister has other things to think about, he’s just not like that.’ Mr Farage said he was ‘jealous’ of how the Tory leader has reversed the greying process while in Downing Street .

David Hyche, now a special agent at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), developed the technology nine years ago when his four-month-old daughter turned blind. A transmitter is placed inside plastic eggs that let off a high-pitched beeping sound. Now Hyche has passed on the idea to the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind in Birmingham. Festive invention: Blind children in Birmingham, Alabama, have celebrated Easter early by hunting for plastic eggs that let of a beeping sound. They trade the eggs in for candy . The device: Bomb expert David Hyche put a transmitter in a plastic egg so his daughter could join the fun . 'With my daughter, one of her first phrases was, 'I do it myself.' She wants to do it by herself and most of these kids want to do that too,' he told WBRC. 'It's logical for people who are explosives investigators. It's just a battery, beeper and a switch... pretty simple.' Giggling and running around the play area at Brimingham's regional center, the blind children filled baskets with the beeping eggs, before trading them in for candy. 'We love to give the opportunity for our children with disabilities and their families to come out and have the same opportunity as everybody else does,' said Tamara Harrison with the Alabama Institute.

Jamyra Gallmon, 21, has been charged with first-degree murder while armed for allegedly killing David Messerschmitt, 30, on February 9 in Washington, D.C. The woman admitted to police that she set up the lawyer using a masculine-sounding email address and went to the upscale Donovan hotel with the intention of robbing him. Scroll down for video . Jamyra Gallmon, 21, (pictured graduating from her military academy high school) has been charged with first-degree felony murder while armed for allegedly stabbing to death 30-year-old David Messerschmitt on February 9 . David Messerschmitt (pictured with his wife Kim) was found dead in his DC hotel room in February. An affidavit revealed on Thursday that he had been soliciting sex from men through Craigslist . According to Gallmon, who was seen on surveillance camera entering the hotel wearing androgynous clothing including black boots, black pants and a black hooded jacket, the room door was open when she arrived. The affidavit stated that the pair got into a struggle and the defendant pulled a knife from her pants and stabbed the victim repeatedly until he fell to the floor where she stabbed him several more times. The victim was found with multiple stab wounds to the back, groin and abdomen along with one wound which pierced his heart and another which hit his spinal cord. His hands had been bound with zip-ties into a pair of makeshift cuffs. His hands were covered in defensive wounds. Messerschmitt had texted his wife Kim Vuong at 7.45pm on February 9 to tell her he would be home in an hour after leaving his law office. He never returned and the next day he was found dead at his hotel room with 'various credit cards strewn about'. He death was declared a homicide. Among the  items recovered from the room were a computer, lubricant, condoms, cell phone and enema kit, Fox DC reported. Fingerprints were also found in the room. Investigators discovered that Messerschmitt had posted a Craigslist ad on February 9, soliciting responses from other men, using 'dcguy456'. The lawyer began an exchange with an individual, using the name 'chrissanchez0906', around 2pm which continued throughout the day. Messerschmitt told the individual his room number at the hotel and gave a meeting time of 7pm - 7.30pm. The email address that the lawyer had been in contact with was linked to Gallmon. On a search of the woman's DC apartment, police found a knife, black boots and gloves, and a pack of zip ties. A discussion in the comments section of a Queerty.com article about Mr Messerschmitt's murder in February included users referencing interactions with an individual using the handle 'dcguy456'. One commenter said that 'dcguy456' had previously posted on the 'M4M' (men for men) section of Craigslist and identified himself as bisexual. Another individual's post claimed that he had exchanged emails with 'dcguy456'and met up with him several years ago. A woman has been arrested in connection to the murder of 30-year-old Washington, DC lawyer David Messerschmitt. Above, the 'person of interest' who was caught on surveillance video entering the hotel where Messerschmitt was killed on February 9. Police confirmed that this was Gallmon . Jamyra Gallmon attended Forestville Military Academy in Maryland and was an exemplary student, a teacher said on Thursday.

Gallmon made an initial appearance on the felony murder charge Superior Court in DC on Thursday. The 21-year-old attended the Forestville Military Academy in Maryland, a coach toldFox 5 on Thursday and had been an exemplary student. She graduated in 2011. Her mother told NBC that her daughter had never been in trouble before and had an ambition to join the military. Coach and teacher, Vincent McDuffie, told the station that she had wanted to play basketball in college but had suffered a knee injury. He said that her supportive family always turned up to watch her high school games. According to the police report, Messerchmitt left his work at law film, DLA Piper, around 5.30pm on February 9 and texted his wife a couple of hours later to say he would back at their Capitol Hill home in an hour. The couple reportedly had not seen each other since February 8, but Vuong didn't think anything seemed wrong with her husband. She reported him missing at midnight, saying it was unlike him to disappear and that usually he got home before her. Messerschmitt was found dead in his room the next day and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities  have arrested a Washington, DC woman named Jamyra Gallmon for the crime.

a8eb7e7d14517a32761b8609a6f4b0b1c7de9597,"Notorious mass murderer Peter Sutcliffe, who has spent three decades in jail, is to be moved to a cushy low security unit, it has been claimed . The families of victims of Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe are furious at plans to move him from Broadmoor to a low-security Priory unit. Mass murderer Sutcliffe has spent more than three decades in Broadmoor for the savage killings of 13 women. But now, despite being one of the country’s most notorious serial killers, Sutcliffe may be moved to a cushy Priory unit set in Berkshire woodland. Sutcliffe is being lined up for the move after he expressed remorse and said he no longer hears the 'voices from God' which he had blamed for his killing spree at his 1981 trial. A report is being compiled which will be heard next month at a prison tribunal which will rule if the move goes ahead. But families of his victims are furious about the move. Neil Jackson, whose mother Emily, 46, became the Ripper's second victim in 1976, told the Sun: 'He should not be moved at all. 'As he's in Broadmoor, he should stay there and they should throw away the key. This just rubs salt into the wounds of families and I believe any remorse he has shown is fake.' A source at the prison told the newspaper Sutcliffe was optimistic about the move - despite being previously turned down for a transfer to the unit which boasts facilities such as a fully-fitted gym and music room. Plans of his referral follow allegations earlier this year that Sutcliffe, who used weapons including a hammer, screwdriver and knives to mutilate women across the north of England, was enjoying an easy lifestyle in jail. Scroll down for video . Potential plans to move Britain's most notorious mass murderer from the high security Broadmoor prison hospital to the Priory . Hospital: Broadmoor's corridors look ordinary, but it houses some of Britain's most disturbed individuals . He was said to be eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, as well as being privileged to receive visitors four days a week who can stay for up to four hours. It was claimed he is also given money to spend in the psychiatric hospital’s shop, and attends a ceramics workshop and twice-weekly Bible studies sessions. It has been claimed that Sutcliffe is now a Jehovah’s Witness and was even given a baptism. In the evenings, he watches TV shows such as The X Factor and I’m A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, the Sun on Sunday reported. A new image of a relaxed-looking Sutcliffe – the first for 20 years – supports the cushy lifestyle claim. There has been little change to his distinctive appearance apart from an increase in weight and the greying of his hair and beard. He had ballooned with some reports estimating his weight at 19 or 20 stone, which is said to be down to a love of chocolate and burgers, and now sufferers from type 2 diabetes. Sutcliffe is currently said to enjoy a cushy lifestyle in Broadmoor eating chocolate, watching television and listening to music, it was claimed . The Priory Thornford Park set in Berkshire woodland . While officials refused to comment on the move, it is thought that Sutcliffe would be transferred to a unit such as the Priory Thornford Park. Based just 30 miles from Broadmoor, it is set in Berkshire woodland and offers a fully equipped gym and running track, a music room and occupational therapy suite. A 'rehab kitchen' and computer  and education rooms are also amongst the high-end facilities at the unit. The red-brick building houses 122 men with mental illness, compared to Broadmoor's 210, with a combination of low and medium secure beds. Past residents include dangerous criminal John Maguir, convicted for assault, who escaped by scaling a wall and child sex abuser Peter Pickering. Its website states its users are 'among the most vulnerable members of society and require sensitive therapeutic interventions delivered in a healing environment that encourages self-awareness, knowledge and empowerment.' The full list of facilities include: . The former trucker, who notoriously targeted prostitutes during his five-year killing spree, has seen his health deteriorate in recent years. He had a hernia operation in 2013 and was reported to have suffered a heart attack. The murderer, who is already blind in one eye after a prison attack, was also told  he could lose what remains of his sight within a year due to an eye condition. He had refused laser eye surgery as he fears it could cause him to lose his vision immediately. The claims about his lifestyle have angered victims’ families. Roofer Neil Jackson, 56, whose mother Emily was Sutcliffe’s second victim, said: ‘He tore apart our family and this just looks like he’s being rewarded. He’s getting an easy life and he’s clearly enjoying every minute. I hope the lifestyle kills him. ‘It doesn’t matter how many years go by, it doesn’t make the pain of what he did any easier.’ Peter Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, after an attack by another prisoner in 1982 with a broken coffee jar . Sutcliffe has been in Broadmoor since he was given 20 life sentences in 1981. As well as the 13 women he killed, he tried to murder seven more in a five-year spree. The killer, who believed he was on a 'mission from God' to kill sex workers, was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 1984. He refused treatment until 1993, when the Mental Health Commission ruled that he should be given anti-psychotic medication forcibly. He has been attacked at least three times behind bars. The second assault put his right eye out and another inmate then unsuccessfully attempted to do the same for his left . It costs taxpayers more than £300,000 a year to detain him in Broadmoor, at least five times the cost of a prison cell. Last year his plea to be moved to a unit in his home county of West Yorkshire was rejected. In 2010, an appeal over his sentence that could have led to him applying for parole was rejected, with a High Court judge saying he should never be released. The Priory and the Prison Service declined to comment on the move while a spokeswoman for the Department of Health, which is responsible for the medical unit, said they would not comment on individual cases.","Serial killer Peter Sutcliffe, 68, was jailed for life for murdering 13 women .

76e0aa30e7033a161a11ce7c4692822772f63ade,"English essential: This laminated document announces the new ISIS nursing school and lists the language entry requirements for would-be nurses . Militants fighting for the Islamic State terror group in Syria have announced that all nurses working in areas under their control must speak English - something the NHS still hasn't introduced. Revealing plans to open a school of nursing in ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa, the extremists also disclosed the tough entry requirements for prospective medical workers. Among them are rules that applicants are no more than 25 years of age, must be willing to work anywhere inside the territory controlled by the extremists, and must speak fluent English. The latter rule is something that even the NHS has yet fully put in place, with nurses who trained in European countries still able to treat patients without any formal language checks thanks to bureaucratic rules barring the Nursing and Midwifery Council testing EU candidates. Details of the first nursing school to be opened in ISIS-held territory were revealed by on Twitter by Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently - an activist group based in the Syrian city that uses a network of brave informers to document the daily atrocities carried out by the Islamic extremists. RIBSS shared a photograph of a laminated document written in Arabic  giving details of the new medical school and listing the entry requirements for would-be nurses. It states that all candidates be aged between 18 and 25, pass an entry exam, impress during an interview, graduated from secondary school with science qualifications, be willing to travel to any ISIS-held area, and willing work for ISIS institutions for at least two years after graduating. The document also states the importance of English - saying candidates will not be accepted without knowing how to speak and understand the language. This is in stark contrast with Britain where English language checks for all nurses are still not being enforced, despite legislation being passed last month making them a legal requirement. Jihadis: ISIS has English language rules for all nurses. The NHS does not have the same level of checks . Although the law has changed, the Nursing and Midwifery Council must engage in a lengthy consultation process, draft new legislation and seek council approval before it can test the English language skills of nurses who trained within the EU. Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating. However the announcement in Raqqa promised that graduate nurses who achieved top grades and showed the most promise at the school will be considered for places as ISIS' medical school, where they can train for better paid jobs such as doctors and surgeons. ISIS' English language rules have been put in place long before the NHS has been able to bring in similar checks. Militants: Students graduating from ISIS' nursing school will be required to spend a full two years working for institutions run by the terrorist organisation after graduating . ISIS has launched English-language radio news bulletins on its Iraqi broadcast service - complete with information on the latest suicide bombings and 'martyrdom operations'. The extremist group's first English bulletin aired on Tuesday on its al-Bayan radio network, which already boasts updates in both Arabic and Russian. The nine-and-a-half minute broadcast, which begins and ends with traditional sounding Arabic music, is hosted by a man with an American accent, who takes the listener through the main events of the day. It also boasts of ISIS fighters 'roasting the flesh' of their opponents, car bombs killing people and destroying an 'idol' and so-called 'martyrdom operations'. It ends thanking the listener for 'tuning in'. Last year the law was changed to make it legal for all foreign nurses, midwives and dentists from outside the European Union to be forced to take an IELTS language exam if it was felt their English made them unsafe in a medical environment. Since then 429 doctors from outside the EU have been refused a licence to practise medicine in the UK because their English language skills are not up to scratch. Similar rules were passed last month extending those rules to prospective medical who trained inside the EU, a rule quickly adopted by doctors and dentists. The rule is still not being by the Nursing and Midwifery Council, however, as the regulator requires a lengthy public consultation process before it can amend its rules. Even then the law will only apply to candidates who medical authorities judge could be a danger due to poor English language skills. In such an instance the nurse would first be required to prove sufficient English language experience - such as from a GCSE-style qualification - or they will be forced to take the British Council's IELTS qualification, to access whether they have reached a suitable level for their job.","ISIS has announced that all nurses working for them must speak English .

7f53ab255bad30f06dccb9041db53f4b8f5ad29c,"Jack Nicklaus recorded his first ever hole-in-one at the Masters on Wednesday, as Camilo Villegas fired two in the space of five holes but still could not win the traditional par-three contest. Villegas holed out on the fourth and eighth as he finished alongside Kevin Streelman on five under par, only to find water on the eighth when he played it again as the third play-off hole. Kevin Streelman holds his trophy aloft after winning the Par-3 Contest on a play-off against Camilo Villegas . Streelman therefore became the latest player to be saddled with the 'curse' of the par-three champion, with no player ever becoming par-three and Masters champion in the same year. However, that was placed firmly into perspective thanks to his 11-year-old caddie Ethan Couch, who has a benign but inoperable brain tumour. Streelman found Couch via the Make-a-Wish Foundation and invited him to be his caddie in the light-hearted curtain-raiser. Augusta National's par-three course traditionally hosts the contest the day before start of the major . 'It was a really fun day, especially to have Ethan with me here,' Streelman said. 'This isn't about me today. It's about helping him out and showing him a great day.' Villegas said: 'I've made a few hole-in-ones, but it's pretty special to make them here. The second one, we were a little more emotional there. We just kind of jumped.' Nicklaus had earlier holed out with an eight iron from 123 yards on the fourth, his ball landing around 15 feet past the pin and spinning back into the hole. Woods played in the Masters par-three contest at Augusta National for the first time in 11 years . That took the 75-year-old six-time champion to three under par, but he would bogey the fifth and hit two balls into the water on the ninth to end his hopes of an unlikely triumph. Former US Open champion Curtis Strange reminded Nicklaus of the tradition that players who make a hole-in-one have to buy the drinks in the clubhouse when Nicklaus walked past the ESPN commentary position. 'Send me a bill,' Nicklaus replied. The Masters official Twitter account shared an image of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods with Niall Horan . The 18-time major winner added on ESPN: 'I never had a hole in one at Augusta, in the par three (contest) or on the golf course. Doing an interview this morning I said all I have to do is go out there, make a hole-in-one and win the par three. I had it three under and then choked.' Since the contest started in 1960, nobody has ever become par-three and Masters champion in the same week, a fact which sometimes sees players deliberately not shoot the best score possible. Most treat it as light relief and invite family or friends to act as their caddies, including Tiger Woods this year for the first time since 2004. Woods had his children Charlie and Sam on his bag and made sure he could not win the event by getting daughter Sam to tap in for par on the sixth. Jack Nicklaus (centre) with Ben Crenshaw (left) and Gary Player (right) during the Par-3 Contest . 'We had an absolutely great time. These were memories for a lifetime,' said Woods, who was also accompanied by girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. He later added on Twitter: 'I'll always have memories of my pop at Augusta and now Sam & Charlie. An amazing day.' Tournament favourite Rory McIlroy had One Direction singer Niall Horan acting as his caddie and Horan proved he should stick to singing after badly hooking a tee shot on the ninth into the water. 'I apologise to golf,' Horan joked. 'I do perform to a lot of people but we were performing to their parents today! There was a lot of pressure.' McIlroy, who is looking to become the sixth player to complete the career grand slam by winning a first Masters title on Sunday, added: 'I wanted to do this because it's a big week for me and just to go into the tournament in a relaxed mood. To spend a couple of hours like this was fun.'","Kevin Streelman beat Camilo Villegas on third play-off hole at Augusta .

But that did not stop the Palestinian youngster, dressed in full combat gear, from attempting to pelt Israeli police with stones during violent clashes on the West Bank. The bemused officers, equipped with helmets and body armour, calmly watched as the child launched his own assault before racing away. The incident raised fears that Palestinian children are being encouraged to mimic and glorify violence. David and Goliath battle: A five-year-old Palestinian boy pelted the Israeli police with stones as violence erupted during a rally in the northern West Bank . The dark-haired child, dressed in combat gear, raced back to safety after launching a series of missiles at around six heavily armed officers . The boy's stone attack came as violence erupted  on the northern West Bank during annual demonstrations to mark Palestinian Prisoners Day. Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd after more than 100 Palestinians rallied near Israel's separation barrier in the village of Bilin, with some throwing stones. At least one protester was believed to have been injured as violence flared on the streets. Prisoners Day is marked every year in solidarity with the more than 6,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails. 'We will not leave our prisoners in jail alone,' rally organiser Abdullah Abu Rahma said. 'We will defend their right to be released, because the majority of them have been arrested illegally by Israeli forces.' With Israel having arrested some 800,000 Palestinians in the occupied territories since 1967 - equivalent to 40 percent of the male population - almost every Palestinian family has been affected. During the last round of US-backed peace talks in 2013 and 2014, Israel freed dozens of long-term inmates. But after the negotiations broke down, and following the kidnap and murder of three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank, Israel arrested hundreds more. The current number of Palestinian prisoners is the highest for at least five years, according to figures from rights groups.

Caldwell has not been put in charge to perform a miracle, but he still insists there is plenty to play for. 'We'll try to win every game,' he added. 'There's 12 points to play for and we'll try to win every one and see what happens. 'It's going to be a long process to get the club to where we want it to be. But tonight was the way we want to play, that's how this club got success.' Fulham should now be safe, having edged nine points clear of the drop zone, but they were booed off by sections of the home support. Boss Kit Symons' honeymoon period seems to be over, as his decision to take off goalscorer Smith after an hour was met with a chorus of 'you don't know what you're doing'. Fulham captain Scott Parker (right) is hassled for the ball by Wigan's Gaetan Bong (left) at Craven Cottage . The ever industrious Parker (left) dribbles away from the challenge of Wigan's Kim Bo-Kyung (right) 'Matt was shattered,' he explained. 'He's had a lot of football recently and we needed some fresh legs.' Symons has the air of a manager who cannot wait for the season to come to an end. 'It's glass half full, glass half empty,' he added. 'We're a point closer to safety and come the end of the season it might be the point that keeps us in the division. 'It's been a tough season, to put it mildly, and realistically it was probably always going to be like that. When we stay up I certainly won't be doing cartwheels, but I'll breathe a sigh of relief.'","Fulham 2-2 Wigan Athletic: CLICK HERE to read the match report .

Jet Set Candy, which offers a collection of destination-specific charms aimed at helping people to choose where they should head on their travels, enables you to take your pick of Britain’s Royals with the Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm, giving users eight possibilities for a 'future husband' - including 'King-to-be George'. 'Fancy your chances with Prince Harry? Got eyes for a Duke? Tie the knot with a British Royal and go from commoner to Queen. Your palace awaits!' reads the description of the fanciful charm, which comes in 14K gold vermeil or sterling silver for $198 and $148, respectively. Here's hoping: Jewelry brand Jet Set Candy's Marry British Royalty Spinner Charm comes in 14K gold vermeil (L) and sterling silver (R) and retails for $198 and $148, respectively . Eligible bachelor: Prince Harry is one of the eight 'future husbands' listed on the charm's playful spinner wheel . The charm has a double-sided Wheel of Fortune-style spinner, allowing wearers to predict their fate with one quick spin. While the front lists one-year-old Prince George and 30-year-old Prince Harry, as well as other more generic options such as ‘Duke’, ‘Marquess’, ‘Earl’, ‘Viscount’, ‘Baron’ and ‘Commoner’, as the options for your future husband, the flip side offers eight 'future homes', allocating you anything from a palace, castle or estate to an abbey, manor, house, cottage – or even foreclosure. Meanwhile, the charm silently acknowledges that 32-year-old Prince William, who is awaiting the birth of his second child with Kate, is already taken - by not mentioning him at all. The jewelry brand, which is perfect for anyone who has the travel bug, also sells similar spinner charms for other cities, as well as various destination pendants, luggage tag charms, link bracelets, engraved bangles and more.

8a785f86259fbb58cea178a9f3bc3753cb98bf63,"First it was revealed that lashings of baby oil were used to keep Aidan Turner's rippling torso looking suitably divine in the hit BBC Sunday night series Poldark. Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer, @AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 . While others have commented that even a smattering is too much. User Laura Kate said: 'I just can't forgive that chest hair. I just can't! But it's Aiden turner I could try. #Poldark'. And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained. 'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.'","Photos taken for BBC show Being Human see Aidan Turner with a full 'rug'

In a shock new poll that will send shockwaves through Downing Street, the Labour leader has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings. The Labour Party has also taken a commanding four point lead over the Tories with just 28 days until polling day, according to the pollsters Survation. Labour leader Ed Miliband has jumped ahead of the Prime Minister in personal approval ratings, a Survation poll has revealed . The revelation comes in the wake of a furious political row over the Labour leader’s personal character – after the Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Miliband could stab Britain in the back like he did to his brother. Mr Miliband responded by accusing the Tories of dragging the election campaign ‘into the gutter’. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader. But the campaign could backfire if Mr Miliband overtakes the Prime Minister in the polls. According to tonight’s Survation poll for the Daily Mirror, with less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. Labour is up 2 points on 35, the Conservatives down one to 31. Nigel Farage’s Ukip, meanwhile, are down three to 15 with the Lib Dems still struggling on just 9 per cent. The SNP and the Greens are on 4 per cent each. It is the biggest Labour lead in a Survation poll since February and was conducted after the party announced plans to scrap a ‘tax loophole’ used by wealthy ‘non doms’ to lower their tax bills. With less than a month until the general election, Labour has opened up a four-point gap over the Tories. The Tories have pinned much of their election hopes on turning the campaign into a straight choice between Mr Cameron and the Labour leader . According to tonight’s poll, nearly seven out of ten voters back Mr Miliband’s proposal to scrap the non dom tax status. Four out of 10 voters ‘strongly’ support the move – with just 14 per cent opposed. The poll surveyed 1,111 people on Wednesday and Thursday. Miliband announced on Wednesday that he wanted to scrap tax rules that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce the amount of tax they pay on money earned overseas. The Survation poll found 59 percent of respondents supported the idea. A separate poll, by Yougov for The Sun newspaper on Wednesday, gave Labour a one percentage point lead over the Conservatives.","Miliband overtakes David Cameron as the most popular political leader .

Corden was all smiles as he posed in between the duo. James Corden (centre) posted a picture alongside Odell Beckham Jnr (left) and David Beckham via Twitter . Both Beckhams, who are of no relation, were pictured in America with the 36-year-old - who is currently filming late-night talk show Late Late in the States. Last month David Beckham lifted the lid on his son Brooklyn's first date, in which the former Manchester United midfielder watched on from a nearby table in a London restaurant. Speaking as a guest on Corden's show, the ex-Real Madrid and LA Galaxy star told the hilarious story of his 16-year-old son's first foray into the world of dating. When probed by Corden, who asked, 'He must be getting quite big into the dating circuit now?', Beckham replied: ''Yeah, it's happening. He's going to hate me for this. 'I'm fine with it, because on his first date - when he was about 14 and a half - it was Valentine's Day so he said, ""I'd love to take this girl to dinner.""

Brooklyn watched on from the audience as his father told the story of his first date, at a sushi bar in London . 'I said, ""Okay, great."" I spoke to Victoria, and she was like, ""Really?"", so I said, ""Yeah, he's going to do it."" 'She said, ""Okay, make sure you take him and then make sure you sit in the restaurant.""

Jets: Firefighters deployed multiple hoses to combat the blaze which wreaked havoc on the area . Exhausted: Firefighters looked tired as they took a break after working at the scene for hours . Blocked: Roads were closed in the wake of the fire, whose cause is still unknown . UK Power Networks said that 100 staff had worked through the night to restore electricity to the area, but it is not known when buildings will regain power. A spokesman said: 'A major gas fire in an underground tunnel is still burning so we cannot yet access our equipment. 'Our engineers have restored power to 2,000 customers and the remaining 1,100 will regain power through generators and cable works as soon as possible. 'We had over a hundred staff working through the night and work continues today. 'We are working with the emergency services and other agencies to keep affected customers updated. The cause of the incident is being investigated.' Fire crews last night doused the hole with water before they smashed the cover open with a sledgehammer, and continued to pump in water from multiple hoses. Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said that the fact the fire started in an underground tunnel meant it had been tricky to bring it under control. 'This has been a technically difficult incident to tackle,' he said. 'The reason that the fire is still burning is because the service tunnel is hard to reach and although firefighters have been applying water through access points throughout the night, the complexity of the tunnel layout means that it will be some time until the fire is fully extinguished. 'However, the fire is contained and we are making steady progress and working with the utility companies and the police to bring this incident to a close.' Works: More than 100 power workers were deployed to restore electricity to businesses in central London . Disruption: The road closures were said to have caused severe traffic jams in the surrounding area . Peter Cowup of London Fire Brigade said the blaze was 'a technically difficult incident to tackle' Deserted: The Holborn area was emptied of workers and shoppers thanks to the disruption . Closure: Shops had signs in their windows apologising for the inconvenience . One council boss warned that there was a 'worrying trend' of pavements exploding in central London and said that businesses had been hit by the accidents. 'We do not fully yet know what caused the fire in Holborn on Wednesday,' said Richard Beddoe of Westminster Council. 'However, pavements have exploded in central London previously and it is a very worrying trend. 'Our message remains the same - we want to see better investment in the capital's infrastructure, as it benefits the whole UK. 'We are relieved to hear that there were no serious casualties, but the losses to big businesses in the West End, due to poor infrastructure, is just not acceptable. We want to see action.' In July, Piccadilly Circus was closed after an electrical fault beneath a manhole cover caused an explosion which resulted in a lorry catching fire. Meanwhile, in February last year, 50 people were evacuated from a street in north London after a pavement burst into flames. And in April 2013, a fireball burst from a pavement in Pimlico Road, central London, narrowly missing a passer-by standing yards away. A UK Power Networks spokesman said: 'There have been a small number of incidents disturbing pavements over recent years, caused by a variety of reasons and affecting utility infrastructures underground.' Blackout: Power was knocked out across the area and more than 1,000 buildings remain without electricity . Dramatic: This aerial image shows how a wide area of London was left without power . Scene: These file photos show tunnels under Holborn near to where the fire broke out . Smoke: More than 2,000 workers were forced to flee their central London workplaces . Among the buildings affected by the fire is the Royal Courts of Justice, home to the High Court and Court of Appeal, which was due to remain closed all day. Somerset House, the London School of Economics and the London Transport Museum were closed, while the English National Ballet cancelled its planned matinée performances of Swan Lake. One of the offices affected by the fire was that of HM Inspectorate of Prisons, which is closed as a result of the power cut. Gillian Perham, 54, lives near the fire and said there had been similar incidents in recent years. 'There was an exploding pavement not far from here last year,' she said. 'We are fed up with it. I'm terrified it's going to happen when I'm near one.' At one point yesterday, 70 firefighters and 10 engines were at the scene of the blaze, which forced a number of West End theatres to cancel shows last night, including The Lion King, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and The Play That Goes Wrong. In a separate incident, 15 engines were called to a fire on an industrial unit in north London.","Main roads in Holborn are closed more than 24 hours after fire broke out .

Paladini has been searching for a way back into football since he left Loftus Road in 2011 and has attempted to buy Birmingham City from Carson Yeung. The Italian seems to have enjoyed more success in West Yorkshire where he has forged an official link to Bradford, a club which has been one of the great success stories of the season. Former QPR chief Gianni Paladini appears to be keen on taking over the reins at League One side Bradford . Bradford's most memorable moment of the season came during their shock FA Cup win over Chelsea . Phil Parkinson’s team captured the imagination of fans across the nation when they fought back from 2-0 down to win 4-2 at Chelsea in the FA Cup and went on to beat Sunderland before losing in a quarter-final replay at Reading. Those FA Cup exploits came against a backdrop of colourful and passionate support. They took 8,000 supporters to Stamford Bridge and generated a brilliant atmosphere for the tie at home to Sunderland. It was a reminder of the club’s enormous potential, having been led out of the doldrums of League Two and administration by chairmen Julian Rhodes and Mark Lawn, with the help of Parkinson’s managerial skill. Lawn has spoken of the need to attract new investment and Paladini is registered as the sole director of Bradford City (Holdings) Limited, set up in February. The company was originally set up with Paladini and Mauro Milanese named as directors but Milanese’s name has been removed. Paladini has previously made an attempt to buy Birmingham from Carson Yeung (pictured) Milanese is a former centre half who played for several Italian clubs and had one year at QPR during a long playing career and briefly managed Leyton Orient last year. Paladini’s ambitions to return to football are well documented. As well as trying to buy Birmingham, he has been linked possible takeovers at Millwall and Reading. Bradford were beaten 6-0 at home by Bristol City on Tuesday, which confirmed Bristol City’s promotion to the Championship and virtually ended Bradford’s hopes of capping an incredible season by reaching the play-offs. Paladini spent eight years at QPR, seizing control after a complicated takeover in 2003 and attracting investment from billionaires Lakshmi Mittal and F1 chief Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore. He left his role at Loftus Road in 2011 following the takeover by Tony Fernandes.","Gianni Paladini has registered as director of Bradford's holding company .

After losing by the same scoreline on Easter Monday, Aitor Karanka's kept their automatic promotion hopes alive with their 14th home win of the season thanks to second-half goals by Lee Tomlin and Patrick Bamford, who also missed a late penalty. But with the top three sides all winning, Boro stayed fourth in the Sky Bet Championship table. Lee Tomlin (centre) scored the opening goal in Middlesbrough's 2-0 win at home to Rotherham on Saturday . Tomlin (centre) is mobbed by his Middlesbrough team-mates after his fine solo effort gives them the lead . Middlesbrough: Konstantopoulos, Kalas, Gibson, Ayala (Woodgate, 70), Friend, Clayton (Whitehead, 79),  Forshaw,  Adomah, Tomlin (Nsue Lopez, 85),  Bamford, Garcia Martinez. Subs not used: Ripley, Vossen, Amorebieta, Wildschut . Goals: Tomlin 50, Bamford 66 .

Booked: Arnason, Frecklington . Referee: Iain Williamson . Attendance: 19,537 . After a quiet start, Boro soon started to find their feet and when Rotherham failed to clear a corner in the 10th minute, returning defender Daniel Ayala tried an ambitious bicycle kick which went straight into Emiliano Martinez's hands. The home side dominated the first half and on the half-hour they had two bites at the cherry. First Ayala's header was cleared off the line before Tomlin's follow-up shot was blocked. It was Albert Adomah's turn to have a pop three minutes later when he shot from just inside the area, but Martinez did well to get down to it, and he was also denied by Danny Lafferty on the line minutes later. The opening goal came five minutes into the second half when Tomlin pressed forward and the Millers defenders stood off the forward, allowing him time and space to plant a low shot past Martinez. The United keeper had to be on his toes again five minutes after the goal when Kike played a smart ball in behind the defence for Bamford, but Martinez did well to smother the ball at his feet. Kike had a shot saved on the hour before Bamford doubled Boro's lead six minutes later with his 16th goal of the season. Tomlin laid the ball off for the Chelsea forward and he took one touch before coolly rolling the ball past Martinez into the bottom corner. Rotherham had a rare shot at goal after 73 minutes when substitute Lee Frecklington hit a powerful drive which had Dimi Konstantopoulos beaten but it flew past his post. Patrick Bamford (left) doubled the Teesiders' lead on 66 minutes with a cool left-footed finish . The 21-year-old celebrates his strike, taking his personal tally to 16 league goals this season so far . But it was Boro who looked like the only side capable of scoring and the third nearly came in the 77th minute when Tomlin clipped an exquisite ball to the back post but Bamford's first-time half-volley was easily saved by Martinez at his near post. Sub Emilio Nsue should have made it three with two minutes to go when he had an open goal but his shot was deflected just wide. And from the resulting corner Kike met Adam Forshaw's ball with a thumping header which Martinez had to tip over the bar. Bamford should have bagged his 17th goal of the season when Richard Wood brought Kike down in the area, but the forward's poor spot-kick was saved by Martinez. However, the on loan Chelsea star failed to add to his tally late on when he saw his penalty saved .","Lee Tomlin's superb solo effort gave Middlesbrough a 50th minute lead .

James May, 52, revealed he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal by ordering a rare  £200,000 Ferrari before Clarkson's sacking after an infamous 'fracas' with producer Oisin Tymon. May says he had ordered the last ever Ferrari 458 Speciale - in bright orange - while the 'draft version' of the lucrative contract was sitting on his desk 'with only a few details to resolve'. But after Clarkson punched Tymon in a rage over a hot meal, the offer was taken off the table. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson (right) and his Top Gear colleagues had been on the brink of a lucrative new contract when Clarkson's infamous 'fracas' led to the offer being taken away . May revealed that he had prematurely celebrated the three-year deal while the contract was still being finalised by ordering a £200,000 Ferrari 458 Speciale in bright orange (pictured) The presenter said the trio had planned to continue making the show until the end of the new contract before leaving 'with dignity'. But Clarkson, 55, was sensationally sacked by the BBC last month and Richard Hammond, 45, joined May in confirming he will not return to Top Gear this week. Writing in a column for the Sunday Times, May said: 'There we were, all three of us, on the brink of a new three-year contract to make Top Gear, after which we would definitely chuck it in with dignity and hand the reins to a new generation, assuming we were still alive . 'There were a few details to resolve about time frames and other mundane stuff, but the groaning draft version of this document was actually sitting on my desk. 'This was a great privilege and a once-in-a-lifetime event; an invitation to continue presenting the world's biggest TV show for – let's not be shy – a handsome salary.' The three men had planned to stay on for another three years before quitting 'with dignity' until Clarkson was sensationally sacked after punching show producer Oisin Tymon (pictured) On the future, he remained vague, suggested the three may be reunited on screen or go in separate directions. Now, May admits ordering a brand new Ferrari is a 'strange' thing for an unemployed person to do, but insists he has no regrets, describing the purchase as a once-in-lifetime opportunity. He acknowledged the supercar was an extravagant purchase at £208,090 but that 'it was better than money in the bank'. Meanwhile, Clarkson was seen talking himself out of a parking ticket for his bright green Lamborghini yesterday after leaving it parked on yellow lines in London. Elsewhere, Hammond told reporters at a charity bike rally that the future will be 'exciting' for the three men, but refused to speculate further on the future of Top Gear. He said: 'Everybody knows what's happened. That's all been in the news. The future, nobody knows yet do they? 'And I cannot and won't speculate further than that. So don't know, let's see. It'll be exciting whatever.' There is mounting speculation the men are working on a new motoring series to be aired by Netflix, Amazon or another British broadcaster. Producer Olsin Tymon had his lip split by Clarkson in the March 4 assault and took himself to hospital with his injuries. Police investigated the attack but Tymon told them he did not want to press charges and officers announced earlier this month they would 'not be pursuing the matter any further.' James May (right) was vague on the future for the trio, hinting that they may be reunited on screen .","James May reveals he celebrated prematurely by ordering £200,000 Ferrari .

Finn was overlooked for the West Indies tour, but has spent time since the World Cup working on his run-up – and watching videos of his best spells as a reminder of why he became the youngest English bowler to take 50 Test wickets. ‘I’ve had my trials and tribulations over the last 12 months,’ he said. ‘But I feel everything at the crease is as I want it to be.

40aaac4df33e238efdecaed02c9adaa916975c2e,"Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 to make it back-to-back wins for the first time since last June. Lineham scored a treble in a losing cause at Castleford last month but his efforts on Friday night settled a drab contest at the KC Stadium. The 22-year-old winger showed good opportunism and no little speed on two occasions to pluck passes out of the air and race over 90 metres to add to his early opener. The hat-trick puts him out in front as Super League's most prolific finisher in 2015. Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching hat-trick as Hull FC beat Widnes 22-8 . Jamie Shaul went over late on to make sure of the two competition points for Hull, with tries from Kevin Brown and Patrick Ah Van unable to prevent Widnes from falling to a fifth away defeat out of five. It was a third match in nine days for both sides, although Widnes had reason to feel more hard done by after their Easter Monday trip to Catalans. Ah Van had an early opportunity to give the Vikings an extra spring in their step but a foot in touch saw his effort ruled out, although Rhys Hanbury's pass was forward in any case. There was no doubt when Lineham slid over in the corner at the other end after Shaul had spun out of a tackle and found his winger with a nice cut-out pass. The Vikings were defending doggedly near their own line to prevent a second Hull try when Stefan Marsh and Chris Dean were both forced off following a sickening clash of heads. Lineham had a good chance to lay the platform for another Hull raid following a break down the right but his pass was intercepted by former Black and Whites hooker Aaron Heremaia. Widnes worked their way downfield and were back level when Brown, whose high kick in the build-up appeared to have gone forward off Ah Van, forced the ball down from dummy half. The Vikings lost a third player as Lloyd White hobbled off, but they thought they had edged in front when Joe Mellor touched down his own dab through, only for the video referee to correctly rule a knock-on. What might have been a half-time lead turned into a six-point deficit as Lineham intercepted Brown's pass and raced 95 metres for a try which took him level with Castleford's Justin Carney on nine for the season. And he was out on his own as leading try scorer when he repeated the trick just after the break, Hanbury the victim on this occasion as he tried to find Ah Van 10 metres from the Hull line. Lineham almost turned provider on the hour mark but his wild pass could not be taken in by Shaul. Jordan Rankin was then wide with a 40-metre penalty attempt after play had been brought back for a shoulder charge by Eamon O'Carroll. But Hull did not have to wait too much longer for their next points as Rankin's grubber kick hit a post and sat up perfectly for Shaul to slide over. Widnes, who saw Gil Dudson held up over the line earlier in the half, gave themselves some hope when Ah Van finished spectacularly in the corner, but it proved no more than a consolation.","Tom Lineham scored two interception tries in an eye-catching display .

00110802bc6eae0e8e4d3d22e27f458f41be2b22,"For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but now new research is questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt . For years medical experts have warned about the dangers of too much salt, but new research is now questioning conventional wisdom and warning instead of the dangers of too little salt. Both federal government regulations and the American Heart Association have for decades warned that excess salt contributes to the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans each year. As the federal government prepares its influential Dietary Guidelines for 2015, some scientists are now saying that the average American salt consumption rate carries no risk. The guidelines currently dictate the people should limit their intake to 2,300 milligrams, with an even stricter 1,500 milligram limit for African Americans and people over 50. In February the  Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended keeping the larger limit, although it withdrew support for the stricter limit for African Americans and people over 50, reports The Washington Post. 'There is no longer any valid basis for the current salt guidelines,' said Andrew Mente, a professor at McMaster University in Ontario and one of the researchers involved in a major study published last year by the New England Journal of Medicine. 'So why are we still scaring people about salt?' While experts on both sides agree that eating too much salt - especially for people with high blood pressure - can be dangerous there is much disagreement over what constitutes too much. The average American ingests about 3,500 milligrams of salt per day - the amount of sodium in a teaspoon of salt - and so under the current dietary guidelines Americans are indeed endangering themselves. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement with at least one former president claiming that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure . Salt skeptics however believe most Americans are fine. In their view, a typical healthy person can consume as much as 6,000 milligrams per day without significantly raising health risks. The skeptics also warn of the dangers of consuming too little - they say that below 3,000 milligrams also raises health risks. The PURE study published last August by the New England Journal of Medicine found that people who conform to the recommended limits (2,300 milligrams) actually have more heart trouble. They found that low sodium may stimulate the production of renin, a hormone that may have harmful effects on blood vessels. Even within the American Heart Association, one of the organizations promoting the current salt limits, there is disagreement. 'The totality of the evidence strongly suggests that Americans should be lowering their sodium intake,' said Elliott Antman, the president of the American Heart Association. 'Everyone agrees that current sodium intake is too high.' But Suzanne Oparil, a former president of the American Heart Association, told the Post that there is no evidence that reducing salt consumption can lower blood pressure. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services has said that the federal guidelines are considering comments from the public and the advice of its science panel.","Current federal government guidelines dictate the people should limit their salt intake to 2,300 milligrams .

Two Florida corrections officers and one former officer trainee have been charged in a plot to kill a former inmate who was getting out of prison, the Florida Attorney General's office said Thursday. An FBI informant met the men -- Thomas Jordan Driver, 25; David Elliot Moran, 47; and Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42 -- after infiltrating a branch of the KKK:  the Traditional American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, CNN affiliate WJXT reported. Driver told the informant that he had gotten into a fight with the inmate and that he and Moran wanted him ""six feet under,"" according to court documents. To convince the suspects that the deed had been done, the FBI staged a fake homicide scene with the former inmate and took pictures to show them that he had been killed.

The Spaniard has been linked with the managerial job at Sampdoria after it emerged that Sinisa Mihajlovic - the current Blucerchiati boss - is being lined up to replace Benitez at Napoli. But Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero has taken inspiration from a favourite chant of the Goodison Park and Old Trafford terraces, appearing to quash rumours that a job swap is imminent. Napoli manager Rafael Benitez jokes with Switzerland Gokhan Inler (right) during a training session . Benitez challenges  Argentinian forward Gonzalo Higuain during a training session earlier today . 'I could take Benitez, but I'd have to take him to see a dietician first,' Ferrero told Radio Crc. 'Anyway, if Mihajlovic does leave, I've already got a replacement. You all say he's leaving, even if I don't know anything about it. 'As far as I am concerned, he's staying. If he were to leave, I'd know who to replace him with. Paulo Sousa's not going to be Sampdoria's next coach, it will be [Italian comedy actor] Lino Banfi.' Sampdoria travel to face Napoli on Sunday trailing Benitez's side by three points, but Ferrero said he would rather keep hold of the Serbian Mihajlovic, who has guided the Genoa-based club from relegation candidates to European contenders in 18 months. 'Napoli would not be taking a step backwards if they were to get Mihajlovic,' Ferrero said. 'I'm talking from my experience and I can say that Sinisa's a man of great sensitivity, a great professional and a great worker. 'He arrives two hours before training and he leaves two hours after. Above everything, he's got incredible ability and if he does leave, then I'm sure whoever gets him will be hitting the jackpot.

The former deputy prime minister said he cannot see a problem with the future King writing to government ministers and insisted he had 'a lot to offer this country'. Lord Prescott's intervention comes after the Supreme Court backed a previous ruling paving the way for the publication of Prince Charles's so-called 'black spider' memos. Lord Prescott, left, said that the Prince of Wales has a lot to offer the country . The letters were penned between September 2004 and March 2005 and sent by the Prince to seven government departments. Lord Prescott, whose letters are separate to those due to be released, said that while he is 'not a raving loyalist', he has 'a lot of time for Charles' who he described as a passionate environmentalist. He said while he listens to the views of everyone who contacts him on political matters, he makes his own decisions. The former Labour minister, writing in the Sunday Mirror, said: ' Charles has an awful lot to offer this country. 'And if he wants to serve his subjects by helping young people into work, combating climate change and building sustainable communities, he can write as many damn letters as he likes.' Lord Prescott published extracts from two letters he received from the Prince - including one expressing his sadness at the death of the Labour politician's mother. The Labour peer said the notes proved 'the measure of the man'. He said: 'They show he has nothing to hide and he shouldn't be worried about publication.' The first letter is a typed ­invitation to a meeting of Regional­ ­Development Agency leaders in 1999. Charles says it would be 'splendid' to see Lord Prescott. The second is more personal and was written in the Prince's ­distinctive handwriting in 2003. It expresses sadness at the death of Lord Prescott's mother. The Prince opens by joking that he has 'been overdoing the quota' of letters to the Deputy PM. Prince Charles - with the Duchess of Cornwall at Ascot races last week - does a lot of good for the country, according to the former Labour minister Lord Prescott . But despite this – and the 'trouble' the press would give him – he goes on to express his sadness and says his 'heart goes out' to the politician. He added: 'I did receive letters from the prince when I was in government but they had no effect on any policy. People say he shouldn't be writing to ministers but he's quite entitled to express his opinion. 'Politicians are lobbied all the time by individuals and groups and none of them would allow a letter – even from Prince Charles – to unduly ­influence them.' Prince Charles has long been accused of 'bombarding' ministers with 'black spider' memos attacking government policy. His letters are so-named after his distinctive handwriting and abundant use of underlining and exclamation marks. Both  Clarence House and the Prime Minister expressed disappointment after the court ruling. The notes reflect,  according to previous attorney general Dominic Grieve, the prince's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs'.","Ex deputy PM said there was no problem with Charles writing to ministers .

Fashion fans who follow many of the top bloggers on Instagram experienced an extreme case of déjà vu over the weekend after the same dress was modelled by no less than 50 fashionistas .

Adweek reports that the bloggers received ‘unspecified compensation’ in return for giving the dress their seal of approval. ‘The goal was to make [the potential customer] stop in her feed and ask why all her favorite bloggers are wearing this dress, and what is Design Lab? Using Instagram as that vehicle is a logical choice, especially when it comes to fashion,’ said Lord & Taylor's CMO Michael Crotty. Many of the posts generated more than 1,000 Likes each, with several surpassing 5,000 Likes and some reaching rarified levels like 13,000 Likes.

The Lord & Taylor deal highlights the gray area of bloggers receiving payment for promoting some goods and services, while others they lend their credability to for free. While newspapers and websites such as the Daily Mail Online have to be upfront and clearly state when something is paid for content, the rules are less stringent on social media. Many celebrities now promote products and luxury brands via Twitter in return for either payment or freebies. Rap star Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan are among the famous names who have been paid by big businesses to promote products to their massive Twitter followings. In leaked Sony emails in December, it was revealed that comedian Kevin Hart had been paid $2 million to send out tweets to his 14.8 million followers promoting The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington, and the Idris Elba film No Good Deed. 'Make sure yo go support my Brother @willpowerpacker this weekend by seeing ""No Good Deed"" .... @TherealTaraji & Idris kill this movie!' wrote the actor on September 12.

'We were being timed (for slow play), which I can appreciate,' Willett said after carding a one-under 71 at Augusta National.

The firm's latest update automatically shows the latest pictures posted to Facebook's site. Tinder also said it had improved its mutual friends feature. Scroll down for video . Tinder will now display the last 34 pictures of a person's Instagram feed - and allow users to see more. Simply open Tinder, go to your new profile, and connect it to your Instagram account with a single tap - your Tinder profile will automatically start displaying your recent Instagram photos. Tinder only displays the last 34 photos, users can venture out to the app for a look at the full library. 'You asked, we listened,' the firm said. 'We’ve made some exciting new changes to your Tinder profile including a slick, new Instagram integration and more common friends.' The firm said it made the changes after noticing many users put their Instagram user name in their profile. 'Now there’s no need to put your Instagram handle in your profile description to tell your story (we got sick of having to do that, too).' It also stressed that the app would not let other visitors to your Instagram feed know it was part of a dating profile. 'And in case you were wondering, Tinder won’t post anything to Instagram on your behalf or alter your existing Instagram privacy settings.' Tinder has overhauled its profile as part of the Instagram integration - and now shows friends of friends as well as more interests . The firm has also used Facebook to boost its 'mutual friends' feature. Tinder now shows you the mutual friends and friends of friends you have in common with your potential matches. 'This adds more context and an extra degree of connection to every swipe,' Tinder claims. It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add. Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’, a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location. A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services. Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base. The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app. Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report. But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100. When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again. But, below this clock, a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’. A price is then shown. But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts. It seems the prices range from around £1.49 a month to as high as £14.99 - but the reasons why are not clear. This means some users will pay £17.88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping £179.88 a year. This equates to some users inadvertently paying £162 more than others over the course of a year. Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release. 'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said. 'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points.' However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity. In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.","Tinder only displays the last 34 photos - but users can easily see more .

Mike Heatlie, 42, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney outside a nightclub in Edinburgh because she did not give him a cigarette. Heatlie, from Edinburgh, was once voted as one of the city's most eligible bachelors and claims to have helped train Stefani before her 2009 U.S tour. At the time, she described him as 'Superman'. Personal trainer Mike Heatlie, 42, (left), who claims to have previously work with Gwen Stefani, launched the violent attack on Fiona McCartney, 43, (right) outside a nightclub in Edinburgh . But Ms McCartney is now facing a £7,000 dental bill and says she is too frightened to leave her home after being assaulted by the personal trainer. He pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March to the attack. He is due to appear again on April 22 for sentencing. Speaking for the first time about the attack, Ms McCartney, a legal PA from Greenbank in Edinburgh, said: 'I used to love going out on Saturday nights. But since the attack I have been very wary and like to be home by a certain time. 'I don't like to go out to nightclubs now and I get very panicky in crowds after this unprovoked attack. 'I'm on sleeping tablets from a doctor because I don't sleep at all. I still have this constant reminder and feel I can't move on because I still have the injuries from that night. I'm reminded every day of this attack.' Ms McCartney said the incident unfolded after Heatlie approached her while she was with a friend outside The Jam House club in March last year. The Edinburgh-based trainer apparently worked on and off with the No Doubt singer (pictured) since 1997 . A testimony which claims to be from Stefani appears on Heatlie's website, which describes him as 'completely passionate' and a 'wonderful motivator' He asked the pair for a cigarette but neither woman had one to give him. He then lashed out and punched her, she said. Ms McCartney said she still suffers from numbness and aching in her mouth. She is also due to have expensive and painful dental work, over the next few months. Heatlie (pictured above) pleaded guilty at Edinburgh Sheriff Court to the attack . Speaking about the incident, Heatlie said: 'This was an unfortunate incident that occurred last year. 'I have been in touch with Ms McCartney and the situation is now very amicable and both parties, I'm sure, would like to move on from it.' In a text message, which Ms McCartney said had been sent by Heatlie to her partner, the trainer wrote: 'Please pass on my sincerest apologies to your partner Fiona, I wanted to get in touch but obviously couldn't with the case proceedings. 'This incident, that I have virtually no memory of, has turned my life upside down and I can't imagine how it has impacted Fiona's. 'I am so sorry, this is completely out of character for me, I've never been involved in a violent incident in my adult life.' Heatlie used an endorsement from Stefani to help promote his new studio when it opened six years ago. At the time, she described Heatlie as being 'completely passionate about health and fitness'. She said: 'I’m so happy for Mike that he’s opening his own studio. I know it will be a huge success. I can’t wait to start working with him again in preparation for our summer tour.

01b4613f86c44ceec7beb897c5167088c61deeac,"Lucky: Selena Dicker, 38, outran the avalanche on Mount Everest in the wake of the Nepal quake . A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker – who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche – described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise £45,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: . Miss Dicker, from Fulham, southwest London,  escaped the wall of snow and rocks as it tore through the Everest base camp on Saturday morning, by running for her life and seeking shelter from a ridge . Tragedy: Miss Dicker, front left, was part of the same climbing party as Google Executive Dan Fredinburg, far top right, who died in the avalanche on Saturday . CUT OFF AND PRAYING FOR A HELICOPTER . Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers – from South Africa – managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London – Chloe Pincho and Brennan White – were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact. Pensioner Ann McNeil, from New Milton, Hampshire, was on an adventure holiday with her two brothers. Daughter Karen Korvin, 40, had set up an urgent appeal for information and announced last night that they had been found. She wrote online: 'I love you, Mum, please come home safely.' Leicester University has paid tribute to post-graduate medical student Marisa Eve Girawong, from New Jersey in the United States, who was killed in the tragedy. Holby City actress Catherine Russell tweeted a picture of a relative, Mike Russell, who was missing. The 42-year-old has since been found. Climbers could be seen sprinting away from the wall of snow and taking refuge in their tents at base camp . ALTITUDE SICKNESS SAVES AMANDA HOLDEN'S SISTER . Amanda Holden said her sister was trapped on the mountain and may have been saved because she had altitude sickness. The Britain's Got Talent judge said Debbie Holden had sent a text message to let her family know she had survived the avalanche. Miss Holden said of her sister, a scuba-diving instructor: 'It's awful, I can barely speak. I'm still quite numb. It's hard to take in what an awful situation it is in Nepal.' She said Debbie had not yet reached Base Camp, where the avalanche struck, because she had been ill and had stopped to recover.

23052beb2829d49cdbbf265dacb09344585becd0,"In a retweet on Thursday, a staffer to real estate magnate Donald Trump managed to capture the coarsest background conversations Americans are having about former secretary of state Hillary Clinton's personal baggage. He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him – to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday – where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump’s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump – In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.","Sawyer Burmeister, a horse-riding champion and sometimes actress, tweeted the barb on Thursday evening .

The Kurdish separatists opened fire from a long distance, targeting Turkish soldiers who were securing an area in Agri ahead of a spring festival, CNN Turk reported. Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the violence and said via Twitter that ""the appropriate answer to the heinous attack in Agri is being given by the Turkish armed forces."" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also harshly condemned the attack, describing it as the Kurdish separatists' attempt to ""intervene in the resolution process (with the Kurds) in our country."" Last month, Abdullah Ocalan, longtime leader of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), called from his jail cell for the violence to end. In a historic letter, he urged fighters under his command to lay down their arms, stop their war against the Turkish state and join a ""congress"" to focus on the future. Since the first incidents more than three decades ago, an estimated 40,000 lives have been lost. The conflict has been, some say, a battle by activists among Turkey's Kurdish minority for independence. It has been, others say, a guerrilla war by rebels who have punctuated their campaign with terrorist acts. About a fifth of Turkey's population is Kurdish -- a minority long living under cultural oppression, most of them in the underdeveloped southeastern part of Turkey.

06b6e2a8279feb2c6be3c3b8a2a7052df536a39a,"An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem. After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood. The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place. Scroll down for video . After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood . According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported. Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'. Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population. However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible. Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago . Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’. The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead. But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side. The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus, . The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged. The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'. Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent. Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all. Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time. He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb. The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry. Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time. Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location. Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’. Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary . Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual . Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist. He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear. Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist. A mosaic of Christ is shown . He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus. Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years. 'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all. 'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray. 'I believe that Christianity started as one of the many mystery faiths that appeared at the time where old Gods and old traditions were rebooted. 'Christianity appears to have been a Jewish mystery faith. David Fitzgerald told MailOnline: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years'. The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown . 'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different ""Lord's suppers"" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs. 'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus.' Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all. 'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time. There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria. 'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record. 'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did.' Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb.’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected.’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological. Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection, which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual. The Talpiot tomb is now sealed under a concrete slab, while the ossuaries found there are in the hands of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The James Ossuary is kept in a secret location by its owner, who lives in Tel Aviv.","Geologist ran 150 chemical tests on ossuaries and 'Jesus Family tomb'

4776b2e669e75793a4ac2a5c5a9b718070d39007,"Nicola Sturgeon will today launch an extraordinary bid to ‘lead the UK’ as she unveils a string of policies apparently tailor-made for a power-sharing deal with Labour. The SNP leader will unveil a manifesto including proposals for British foreign policy, welfare payments, energy bills and English university tuition fees. Several of her election pledges overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS. Others are calculated to drag a minority Labour government to the left, including halting the roll-out of Iain Duncan Smith’s popular changes to benefits and cancelling the Trident nuclear weapons system. Scroll down for video . Control: The Tories warn SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon will be Ed Miliband's puppet master if he becomes Prime Minister after the election . Several election pledges in Miss Sturgeon's manifesto overlap with Labour policy, including slashing tuition fees in England from a maximum of £9,000 a year to £6,000, and rolling back competition in the English NHS . The SNP also wants the UK to formally recognise Palestine as a state, give energy regulator Ofgem the power to force suppliers to cut prices and to increase public spending on infrastructure in northern England and Wales. At the heart of the SNP’s manifesto are plans for what Miss Sturgeon has called ‘modest’ spending increases funded by yet more borrowing – but which in fact total £180billion over five years. Scotland’s First Minister, who is not herself running for a Westminster seat, said yesterday the SNP had much in common with Left-wing Labour MPs and aimed to build a ‘progressive alliance’ for people ‘right across the UK’. ‘There is an opportunity to build progressive alliances for progressive policies. It is a real rather than a pretend alternative to austerity,’ she told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. Today’s SNP election manifesto will be the first to be the focus of intense national scrutiny. Polls suggest the party is on course for a landslide victory north of the border, winning as many as 50 seats and holding the balance of power at Westminster. That could trigger constitutional turmoil of the sort that followed the 1910 election, when Irish Nationalists surged and ended up with more than 70 seats. In the years that followed, there was bitter conflict and the larger part of Ireland eventually seceded from the UK. The huge surge in support for the SNP could see senior Labour figures such as Jim Murphy (left) and Douglas Alexander (right) lose their seats . The latest Scotland-wide YouGov survey shows the SNP on a record 49 per cent, up three, with Labour trailing on 25 per cent, down four. The Conservatives were on 18 per cent and Liberal Democrats on just four per cent. The scale of the shift in traditional Labour strongholds in Scotland is unprecedented in modern European politics. Even senior Labour figures, including the Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and the shadow foreign secretary and the party’s election campaign coordinator, Douglas Alexander, are facing defeat. The SNP will declare today that a ‘strong team’ of SNP MPs in Westminster would help ‘rebalance the UK - both politically and economically - from the chronic over-dominance of the City of London, which has harmed the overall UK economy and left regions of England neglected’. Miss Sturgeon insisted those who had asked Scotland to remain in the UK in last year’s independence referendum could not now object to it calling the shots at Westminster. ‘We were told by leaders of the No campaign during the closing stages of the referendum debate that Scotland’s voice really mattered. Indeed, we were told that Scotland shouldn’t leave the UK but lead the UK,’ she said. ‘So it is more than a bit rich, now that Scotland has decided to remain part of the Westminster system, for anyone in London or elsewhere to try and imply that Scotland’s voice shouldn’t be heard or that Scotland’s voice somehow becomes an illegitimate one if people here decide to elect a large number of SNP MPs.’ However, the First Minister will face tough questions at today’s launch over her plans for ‘full fiscal autonomy’ or effective ‘home rule’, which would see almost every power apart from foreign affairs and defence devolved to Holyrood. It would end the generous Barnett Formula that funds Scotland. The Institute for Fiscal Studies  has predicted that a ‘fiscally autonomous’ Scotland would have a £7.6billion black hole in its finances.","Nicola Sturgeon will today unveil SNP manifesto as a 'bid to lead the UK'

d604fabaf467a3c3e29e2314304c9cadedb31514,"Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed. Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight. Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows. Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers.' A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight . The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person... on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job. Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity. According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18.5 and 24.9. If a person's BMI is 25 to 29.9, they are classed as overweight. At between 30 and 39.9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese. Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers. Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability. But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'. It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability'.' Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'. 'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making ""stereotypical assumptions"" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added. Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said. Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout. Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing: . The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff. In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability, after a case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, pictured, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat . Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met. Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers. Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned. More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.","Survey of 1,000 firms showed half are less inclined to recruit obese people .

The revelation follows widespread public anger at Indonesia's executions of Australian nationals Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan despite the pleas of the Federal government. It also comes as one of the few Australians known to be facing death row in China - Sydney man Peter Gardner - had his case pushed forward by six months. 'The number and seriousness of current cases of Australians potentially facing the death penalty in China is unprecedented,' said the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade document, which was dated December 2, 2014. Chinese authorities have said that eleven Australians were apprehended on suspected drug smuggling charges in Guangzhou alone in 2014 - a crime punishable by death. Scroll down for video .

The exact number facing possible death sentences was redacted in the briefing, obtained under freedom of information laws, which added: 'None of those detained was born in China or is a former Chinese national. 'All were arrested for drug-related offences'. The document said consular assistance was provided to the Australians, including monitoring developments, prisoner welfare visits, and keeping in contact with family or nominated contacts. Other possible steps appeared to be redacted. Chinese prosecutors are reportedly seeking the death penalty against jockey Anthony Roger Bannister, 43, from Adelaide, who was charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle 3kg of methamphetamine from Guangzhou to Australia.

Ms Davis was freed without charge following a traumatic month in a Chinese prison last year where she was forced to crop her hair short. The pair had met on Tinder. Ms Davis's friends realised something was wrong when she failed to appear as a bridesmaid at a friend's wedding in early November. The file also revealed the importance the government placed in not speaking publicly about her case at the time of her imprisonment. 'Given the timing of the investigative period and the possible death penalty involved,' DFAT asked that 'no information about this case be disclosed.' Authorities alleged Gardner tried to smuggle 30kg of methamphetamine out of China to Australia. When Ms Davis returned to Sydney, her father revealed she was cleared by Chinese authorities because she had carry-on luggage only . Rose Kulak, death penalty campaigner for Amnesty International, told Daily Mail Australia: 'China executes more people than the rest of the world combined.' 'With a 99 per cent conviction rate in China, once you are sentences to death, it is a very precarious situation you are in,' Ms Kulak said. Approximately 8 per cent of all recorded executions in China last year were carried out for drug-related crimes, Amnesty said.

Arsenal may pull out of the running to sign Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling following recent events . Brendan Rodgers has backed his wayward star but contract stand-off has created tension at Liverpool . Sterling's decision to hold his now infamous BBC interview without Liverpool's permission is said to have surprised those at north London.

Arsene Wenger's side were far from their best, but Aaron Ramsey's early goal put them ahead and Burnley, for all their endeavour, didn't create too many clear-cut chances. Here's how Sportsmail rated each player... Burnley . Tom Heaton: Saved well from Ozil in the build-up to Arsenal’s goal but was unfortunate his defenders could not clear. 7 . Kieran Trippier: Forced Ospina into a good save with a curling free-kick and delivered well from corners. 6 . Jason Shackell: At fault for Arsenal’s opener as his sloppy pass gave possession away cheaply. 5.5 . Michael Duff: The 37-year-old did a good job of keeping Giroud under wraps and provided a threat from corners. 6.5 . Ben Mee: Made a superb block to deny Ramsey a second after a brilliant lobbed pass from Ozil. 7 . Ben Mee was booked in the first half for a blatant block on Aaron Ramsey, but responded well . Michael Duff goes up to challenge Arsenal's in-form striker Olivier Giroud during the hard-fought encounter . George Boyd: Full of running as ever but failed to trouble Arsenal when in possession of the ball. 6 . Scott Arfield: Another full of industry and almost provided an assist for Ings with a clever lob. 6 . David Jones: Brought calmness and quality to Burnley’s midfield but could not find a killer pass. 6.5 . Ashley Barnes: Wide left is not his favoured position but put Bellerin under pressure with and intense work ethic. 6 . Danny Ings: Starved action but went close with an acrobatic effort from Arfield’s chip into the box. 6 . Sam Vokes: Saw an early chance go begging when he fired at Ospina from close range. 6 . Subs: Taylor (for David Jones) 90 . George Boyd, who missed a great chance for Burnley on the half-volley, tackles Francis Coquelin . Scott Arfield tries to get to grips with Mesut Ozil as Burnley worked exceptionally hard against Arsenal . Arsenal . David Ospina: Was perhaps busier than he might have expected and had to make decent saves to deny Vokes and Trippier. 7 . Hector Bellerin: Faded after a bright start. Pinned back by Barnes’ aggressive closing down. Nutmegged by Mee. 6 . Laurent Koscielny: Kept a close eye on Danny Ings and restricted the Burnley top-scorer to just one chance. 7 . Per Mertesacker: Given a good, physical battle by Vokes and just about came out on top. 7 . Hector Bellerin is chopped down by Ashley Barnes as Burnley targeted the young Spanish full back . Laurent Koscielny suffered a few difficult moments as Arsenal sought to continue their excellent form . Nacho Monreal: Made a vital interception and clearance to thwart a chance for Ings. 6 . Francis Coquelin: Has developed into a key member of Arsenal’s midfield and did another fine job as the anchor man.7.5 . Mesut Ozil: Less effective than he was against Liverpool, with only flashes of brilliance. 6 . Aaron Ramsey: Applied the finishing touch after a goalmouth scramble to get the Gunners noses in front. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey fires home to put Arsenal ahead despite several Burnley defenders' best efforts . Santi Cazorla: Left his shooting boots in north London. The Spaniard whipped a free-kick narrowly wide and sent an ambitious left-foot volley over the bar. 6 . Alexis Sanchez: Saw plenty of the ball in the wide left channel but Burnley coped well to nullify the Chilean’s threat. 6 . Olivier Giroud: Marked out of the game by Burnley’s centre-backs and hardly had a kick before being replaced. 5 . Subs: Welbeck for Giroud (81), Chambers for Sanchez (90) Referee: Mike Dean 6.5 . Alexis Sanchez appeals for a free kick in a game where Burnley's tough tackling caused him some problems . Olivier Giroud holds the ball up, but couldn't add to his six-game goalscoring run at Turf Moor .","Francis Coquelin superb in protecting Arsenal back four at Turf Moor .

And now, Rita Ora - who is only 24 and has already made the transition from a Kosovan-born fledgling singer to one of the globe's most successful stars - has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range. For her latest collaboration with adidas Originals, Rita has taken the brand's classics and put her own bold spin on them. The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself. Scroll down for video . Rita Ora has channeled her passion for fashion into a new adidas range, so FEMAIL caught up with the global star to find out her influences and plans for the future . Speaking to FEMAIL about the inspiration behind her new range, which is emblazoned with graphic dragon prints and lands on May 1, Rita said: 'The Dragon print is all about my love of travel and soaking up different cultures. The print itself is inspired by Asian culture and one of its most recognisable symbols. 'I’ve contrasted that with the fit, basketball style cuts, which were inspired by American culture. My White Smoke pack is about the body-mind-soul connection, about taking a moment for reflection. The graphic comes from the visual smoke creates when burning incense.' The talented star, who also recently unveiled a beauty range for Rimmel, couldn't be happier with the final result. She said: 'I love being able to go into design meetings with all these crazy ideas and then be able to create a product that hasn’t existed before. From the initial stages to seeing my fans wearing the clothes and shoes - it’s been an amazing experience.'

The result? A collection that is as daring and vibrant as the designer herself . Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises there’s 'a little something for everyone'. 'Each one of my packs has a different cut and style to it,' she explained. 'I’m more of a tomboy myself but I also love to get dressed up and wear a big dress, so my designs embody that contrast. 'I’m always about wearing what looks and feels good to you, not about following trends. So I try to create clothing that fits that, allowing the person wearing it to make it their own however it fits their own personal style.' Rita used her own 'street, funky and bright' sense of style as a point of reference, but promises the range, pictured, offers 'a little something for everyone' Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career. 'I’ve always loved that London street style, but I’ve started to fuse it with a more American style the more time I’ve spent here,' she said. 'But UK or US, I’ve always been a sneakerhead. Adidas has always been a staple in my closet, so it was a natural fit for me to collaborate with them, I’m just grateful they wanted to work with me!'. Citing Marilyn Monroe as her ultimate postergirl, Rita, pictured judging on The Voice, explains that her style has evolved as a result of her transatlantic career . As well as conquering the fashion world, the humble star has been busy making music, starring in Fifty Shades Of Grey and spending time with her beau, Ricky Hilfiger. So does she ever have a day off and what does she get up to? 'Whenever I have a day off, I spend the day in my bed, watching movies, in my pyjamas, eating takeaway,' she revealed. 'I guess it’s probably fortunate that I don’t have too many days off, but I always like to take full advantage of any down time I can get.' Thanks to her countless projects and array of starry friends, it seems that The Voice coach is taking over the world.  'Aw, thank you!,' she replied. 'It’s great to be able to give a try to so many different things. 'I’m just starting to get more into the Hollywood movie world, so I’d love to continue down that path. But music has always and will always be my main love and passion. 'In five years' time, hopefully I will still be creating music and being able to live my dreams surrounded with the people I love.

The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider is widely regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made. But it is best known for that infamous scene in the 1986 teen comedy starring Matthew Broderick. The car, in classic Ferrari red, was the pride and joy of the father of Ferris Bueller's best friend Cameron in the movie. That was until the friends take the model out for a spin which results in the convertible accidentally smashing through its glass showroom doors into the ravine below. A stunning Ferrari - which is almost identical to the model driven in cult eighties classic film Ferris Bueller's Day Off is up for auction . The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT SWB California Spider (pictured) is regarded by many as the most beautiful convertible ever made . But its most famous moment came it was used as the car for the 1986 teen comedy Ferris Bueller, starring Matthew Broderick . In the movie, Ferris took best friend Cameron's dad's red model out without permission but the car eventually trashed . You killed the car: In one of the film world's best-known scenes, the beloved Ferrari crashes into the ravine below after Cameron accidentally knocks it off the jack . This car, however, is in significantly better condition and has recently undergone a full restoration by Ferrari in Maranello. One of just 16 in existence, it has a 3-litre V12 engine which develops around 280bhp. It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph. It will be sold next month at RM Sotheby's auction in Villa Erba, Italy, and has a guide price of around £8 million. The Ferrari, featuring the distinctive logo on the steering wheel, will be sold next month at RM Sotheby's auction in Villa Erba, Italy, and has a guide price of around £8 million .

It will do 0-60mph in less than 7 seconds and hit a top speed of more than 150mph and in the auction catalogue, RM Sotheby's called it 'the most celebrated open-air Ferrari ever made' and 'an automobile with few peers' But it is expected to sell for significantly more after a model previously owned by the French actor Alain Delon and requiring a full restoration sold for £12.5 million earlier this year. Peter Wallman, car specialist at RM Sotheby's, said: 'Perhaps the most beautiful convertible car ever made, and featuring the powerful Colombo designed 3.0-litre V12 engine, this spacious and versatile two-seat sports car with race car performance is the ultimate road going Ferrari of all time.' The car's ability to be driven at high speed on the track as well as comfortably across continents boosted appeal to a number of high profile customers. Hollywood star James Coburn owned one - with Chris Evans buying it in 2008 for a then world record £5.6 million. The Delon car sold for more than twice this figure seven years later. This model, known as chassis 2505 GT, was originally bought by an Italian driver before the ownership was passed to a Swiss person. It was later owned by a Brit and is currently back in Italian ownership .

It added: 'Ownership of such an automobile, both now and when new, is something that almost every Ferrari enthusiast aspires to yet something that few can attain. 'It is the epitome of la dolce vita in the automotive world, as it combines timeless style with incredible performance, and it is an automobile equally capable of pleasing its owner on the open road, the race track, or both in a single day.

35d559779b0b9849bd394864a13c14eaa845f877,"A robot has been 'arrested' by Swiss police after it bought a supply of illegal drugs on a hidden region of the internet known as the 'dark net'. The automated computer program was designed as an online shopping system that would spend up to $100 each week by randomly purchasing an item offered for sale on the deep web. The robot would then have its purchase mailed to a group of artists who then put the items in an exhibition in the town of St Gallen, in north east Switzerland. The Random Darknet Shopper purchased a number of items for sale on the deep web (pictured) including trainers, jeans, cigarettes, a set of masterkeys and a DVD case (far left) containing 10 ecstasy tablets . The items it bought included a pair of Nike trainers, counterfeit designer jeans, the scan of a Hungarian passport and a set of UK Fire Brigade masterkeys. However, it seems the Random Darknet Shopper crossed the line when it purchased 10 Ecstasy tablets, which arrived in a vacuum packed bag hidden in a DVD case. The dark net is a subsection of the deep web - the part of the internet that does not show up in searches or on social media. Most of the information on the web is far down on dynamically generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search engines, which are rather like dragging a net across the surface of the sea, missing much of the information in the depths. The dark net is used as a way of sharing information and trading goods, but the anonymous and encrypted nature of it has attracted large amounts of illegal activity. The Silk Road website and its successor that were recently shut down was used to sell drugs in exchange for bitcoins, the electronic currency. Other dark net sites allow users to share pornographic photographs, hacked information, credit card numbers and other illegal goods. The Silk Road used an underground computer network known as the The Onion Router (TOR), which is a matrix of encrypted websites and servers that disguise the identity of users. It uses numerous layers of security and encryption, hiding the IP address and the activity of the user. Just 0.26 per cent of the daily internet traffic from the UK accesses this hidden part of the internet. Police seized the drugs, the computer and the rest of the items it had purchased. Tests on the tablets later revealed they contained 90mg of the class-A drug MDMA, which the police then destroyed. The computer and the empty bag the ecstasy came in have now been returned to the group behind the bot, !Mediengruppe Bitnik, along with the other items it bought. They described the police's actions as an 'unjustified intervention into the freedom of art'. Writing on their blog, London based artists Carmen Weisskopf and Domagoj Smoljo, who were behind the project, said: 'Random Darknet Shopper has finally been released and is now back in our possession. 'At the same time we also received the order for withdrawal of prosecution. 'In the order for withdrawal of prosecution the public prosecutor states that the possession of Ecstasy was indeed a reasonable means for the purpose of sparking public debate about questions related to the exhibition. 'The public prosecution also asserts that the overweighing interest in the questions raised by the art work Random Darknet Shopper justify the exhibition of the drugs as artefacts, even if the exhibition does hold a small risk of endangerment of third parties through the drugs exhibited. 'We as well as the Random Darknet Shopper have been cleared of all charges. This is a great day for the bot, for us and for freedom of art!' The Random Darknet Shopper project was set up as an attempt to highlight some of the dilemmas that can be thrown up by dark net markets and anonymous internet use. It used Bitcoin to randomly purchase items that were offered for sail in the darknet. The tablets, pictured above, were sent from Germany inside a DVD case and a vacuum sealed foil bag . They were delivered to the artists by mail and then put on display in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen. During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes. The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous. The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities . It has become notorious as a place to buy illegal pornography, drugs and weapons. The robot software bought the ecstasy in October. It was sent from Germany to Switzerland and apparently crossed the border hidden in a DVD case without being intercepted by the authorities. The drugs were allowed to remain on show in the exhibition until it ended in January. However, the police raided the exhibition when it came to an end and seized the computer and its purchases on the grounds the drugs were an endangerment of third parties. Speaking to the Guardian, Mr Smoljo said that they had been told although the computer had purchased the drugs itself, they were the legal owners of the drugs as they had executed the code behind the software. The case has raised important questions about the use of automatic shopping bots and the use of the darknet. In the past the artists have used technology to intercept CCTV images and sent a package to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Mr Smoljo and Miss Weisskopf said: 'The Random Darknet Shopper is a live Mail Art piece, an exploration of the deep web via the goods traded there.'","Random Darknet Shopper is a computer bot that randomly purchases an item every week from a hidden part of the internet called the dark net .

b91e6223fb91f7a29fcc925a7a04ef72075eaab2,"Britain's five highest-earning NHS dentists are paid average salaries of £690,000 a year. The sum is almost five times the Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet – and comes as thousands of patients struggle to get on the books of NHS practices. A further 11 dentists were paid between £400,000 and £500,000 and a total of 177 received more than £200,000. More than 1,600 pocketed £100,000-£200,000. The figures lay bare the huge amounts of taxpayers’ money paid to dentists for NHS work, following Labour’s introduction of controversial contracts in 2006. Scroll down for video . Lucrative: Some dentists earn from multiple NHS contracts, as well as private patients . Campaigners said the payments were ‘scandalous’ and ‘unacceptable’. Under freedom of information laws, the NHS Business Services Authority was asked about the pensionable pay of dentists who do NHS work. In 2012/13, the latest figures available, five practitioners were paid more than £500,000. They shared a total of about £3.4million – an average of £690,000. This comes on top of any money they take from treating patients privately. Another 11 earned £400,000 to £499,999 from the NHS, 30 received £300,000 to £399,999, 131 pocketed £200,000 to £299,999 and 1,617 received £100,000 to £199,999. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said the rates of pay were ‘exorbitant’. Yesterday's Daily Mail . She added: ‘Investment is urgently needed on the front line where there is a desperate shortage of nurses [and] patients waiting for hours in A&E … when the NHS is under such huge financial pressure, this type of spending on huge salaries is unacceptable.’ It follows revelations in Thursday’s Mail that millions of pounds was being wasted on NHS prescriptions for suncream and toothpaste. Yesterday, the Mail also exposed a £2,700 charge for cataract surgery at some hospitals – treble the cost to the health service – raising suspicions that patients are being ripped off. Patient Concern’s Roger Goss said: ‘This is scandalous. People will be shocked to hear the sums lining dentists’ pockets when it is almost impossible to find dental care on the NHS in some parts of the country. ‘There is something strange going on when the NHS will pay for gastric bands, suncream and hangover tablets yet it is so difficult to get dental treatment on it. It is almost perverse.’ Jonathan Isaby of the Taxpayers Alliance, which the Mail commissioned to carry out the research, said the salaries show a ‘shameless public sector elite taking taxpayers for a ride’. He added: ‘It is outrageous that these telephone-number salaries have been hidden from the people who pay them … Taxpayers expect the money they put in to the NHS to be spent on patients, not on bumper pay packets.’ The contracts brought in by Labour were designed to improve access to NHS dentistry. But patients are still struggling to get an appointment. The pay deals gave practitioners a fixed sum for a set amount of work agreed at the start of the year, rather than separate incomes for the number of patients treated or procedures done. Thursday's Daily Mail . Treatments are divided into three bands, from a simple check-up earning the dentist £25, to procedures such as fitting dentures and crowns, for roughly £300. The value of a contract can run to millions of pounds, and some dentists run more than one practice so hold multiple contracts. According to the Health and Social Care Information Centre, 21,500 dentists did NHS work in 2012/13, but most also do substantial amounts of private work. The British Dental Association’s Mick Armstrong said the top-earning dentists ‘most likely own a group of practices’ or are specialists in their area. But Tory Charlotte Leslie, who sat on the health select committee of MPs, said: ‘Most people will be absolutely stunned individual clinicians are getting such astronomical salaries on the NHS.’ A spokesman for NHS England said it contracts the vast majority of dental services from self-employed individuals or companies, some of whom ‘earn income from a number of contracts’.","Highest-earning NHS dentists earn almost five times more than Prime Minister’s £142,500 pay packet .

91b802bf26bef2ab42a5f02b4beab497f690a8f8,"Voters are still 'in the dark' about the scale and depth of spending cuts being planned by all the main parties with just two weeks until polling day, economic experts warned today. Analysts from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said none of the major parties had given 'anything like full details' on how they will tackle the nations' debts after the election. The Tories were accused of giving 'no detail' about their deficit reduction plan, which relies on £30billion of cuts, while Labour has left the door open to borrowing an extra £26billion-a-year. Scroll down for video . The Institute for Fiscal Studies analysed the policies of all the main parties to see how their policies would increase borrowing . The IFS warned that the promise of tackling the deficit in the next Parliament is based on 'almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases'. The think-tank reached its conclusions after a detailed study of the party manifestos ahead of May's General Election. It accused Tory Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls of failing to spell out exactly where the axe will fall. IFS deputy director Carl Emmerson said: 'There are genuinely big differences between the main parties' fiscal plans. 'The electorate has a real choice, although it can at best see only the broad outlines of that choice. 'Conservative plans involve a significantly larger reduction in borrowing and debt than Labour plans. 'But they are predicated on substantial and almost entirely unspecified spending cuts and tax increases. 'While Labour has been considerably less clear about its overall fiscal ambition, its stated position appears to be consistent with little in the way of further spending cuts after this year.' Chancellor George Osborne and his Labour opponent Ed Balls are accused of not spelling out how they will tackle the deficit . George Osborne received a pre-election boost today as official figures showed he beat his target for reducing annual public sector borrowing for the latest financial year by nearly £3 billion. Borrowing - excluding the effect of bank bailouts - was £87.3 billion for the year to the end of March, down from £98.5 billion in 2013/14, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The result undershot the latest target of £90.2 billion set by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) at the time of last month's Budget. It means that annual borrowing (GDP) has fallen by more than £60 billion from £153.5 billion in 2009/10 just before the Coalition came to power. As a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) it has dropped by half from 10.2 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, underlying debt of £1.48 trillion is more than £500 billion higher than the 2009/10 figure of £956 billion. The nation's debt represents 80.4 per cent of GDP, up from 62 per cent five years ago. The IFS analysis said the Tories planned the largest reduction in borrowing over the course of the next Parliament. It said the party would require large spending cuts or tax increases to achieve this. Research economist Soumaya Keynes said: 'The Conservatives have said they want to eliminate the deficit but provided next to no detail on how they would do it. 'They should be forthcoming on the £5 billion of largely unspecified clampdown on tax avoidance, the £10 billion of unspecified cuts to social security spending and, according to our calculations, further real cuts to unprotected departments of around £30 billion.' Turning to Labour, the IFS said the Opposition had been 'considerably more vague' about how much it wants to borrow. The pledge to produce a surplus but without specifying by when or how much could be consistent with a reduction in borrowing totalling 3.6 per cent of national income. Senior research economist Rowena Crawford said: 'Labour's proposed measures might be broadly enough to meet their target for only borrowing to invest. 'But this would leave borrowing at £26billion a year in today's terms. 'If Labour wanted to reduce borrowing to a lower level than this they would have to spell out more detail of how they would get there.' The IFS said the Liberal Democrats had been more transparent about overall fiscal plans to 2017-18, revealing that they are aiming for a tightening more than Labour but less than the Conservatives. The SNP's figures imply the same reduction in borrowing as Labour, the IFS said, although the reduction would be slower. This means the SNP is proposing a slower but longer period of austerity, the think-tank said. The independent analysis came as the main parties clashed over the economy, with Labour accusing the Tories of planning the biggest spending cuts in any of the world's advanced economies and the Conservatives renewing warnings that Britain's economy would suffer from an 'SNP/Miliband nightmare'. Labour's Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: 'The IFS has confirmed that the Tories are committed to the most extreme spending plans of any political party, with bigger cuts than any other advanced economy in the next three years. 'The Tories might be able to make the cuts but the last five years show they will fail to cut the deficit as they claim. They have borrowed £200 billion more than they planned because their failure to boost living standards has led to tax revenues falling short.' But Mr Osborne today warned that every family in the country will be left £350 worse off if the SNP is left calling the shots in a Labour government. The Chancellor warned of a 'dangerous cocktail' if Ed Miliband is at the mercy of SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon. With polls showing no party will win an overall majority, Mr Osborne claimed it would spark a 'constitutional crisis' if Scottish nationalist MPs held the balance of power in the UK government. Launching the SNP manifesto this week, Ms Sturgeon named her price for supporting Labour in any post-election deal. She demanded her MPs have a say over the running of the whole of the UK, raising the prospect of Scottish nationalists calling the shots on policies which only apply south of the border. And she unveiled a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain to drag Labour to the left, including an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Mr Miliband would have to pay for getting into Number 10. Mr Osborne seized on the demand for more spending and more borrowing and warned that Treasury analysis suggests it would add £6billion to Britain's interest bill, worth £350 per family. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's a new feature of this election that a Labour party cannot win an overall majority, so they would rely on this deeply unstable block of Scottish Nationalists. 'We've got a strong plan for a national recovery, but it's perfectly reasonable to point out with two weeks to go until this election the alternative is what Gordon Brown described last night as 'constitutional chaos'. 'The Scottish Nationalist leaders would clearly be the stronger force in a Labour minority government propped up by them.' Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The politicians seeking our votes owe it to taxpayers to come clean about what spending the country can, and cannot, afford. 'This candour has so far been noticeably absent in the election campaign, with politicians failing to acknowledge the dire state of the public finances and instead clambering over each other to make additional and apparently unfunded spending pledges.'

The long distance runners will inspire many to take up running and as the evening gets lighter and the weather gets warmer, it's the perfect time to pull on your trainers and get fit. But what trainers should you go for? Running is often celebrated as a budget sport because you don't have to pay expensive gym fees or buy lots of equipment. But trainers can be costly - proved by the latest adidas Boost shoes that have gone on sale for £130. Femail writer and marathon runner Lucy Waterlow tested out £130 adidas Ultra Boost trainers against Aldi's budget £19.99 pair ahead of the London Marathon next week . In contrast, supermarket chain Aldi have a running flash sale in stores from tomorrow (Thursday) with trainers available for the budget price of £19.99, while stocks last. The shoes you run in are important to prevent injuries and ensure you have a comfortable and enjoyable experience - so can you really get the same results from a cheap supermarket pair over the costly version from a major sports brand? FEMAIL asked Lucy Waterlow, a marathoner with a personal best time of 3.06 and co-writer of Nell McAndrew's Guide To Running, to take them for a test run... THE TRAINERS . Adidas Ultra Boost, £130: Adidas promise to deliver 'your greatest run ever' with their new trainer which features their much-hyped 'Boost' technology. This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer. Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly. The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At £130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable . It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals. Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013. Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of £130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever. 'All of the very best in adidas technology has been combined to create a shoe that provides industry leading Energy Return, alongside unprecedented adaptability and comfort.' Aldi Premium Running Shoes, £19.99: The premium running shoes are part of the Aldi's latest 'Specialbuys' running range under the label 'Crane', which will be in stores from 16th April and available while stocks last. It's not the first time Aldi have sold running trainers as a non 'premium' version went on sale for £14.99 in 2013. Aldi's £19.99 premium running shoes for women comes in a turquoise and pink shade . The men's version is royal blue and will only be available in stores while stocks last . Aldi say their running range is 'high spec' despite the low prices, as they keep their costs down by stocking their own products over big brands, having minimalist store interiors to reduce overheads and charging for plastic bags. The supermarket chain aren't in the business of sponsoring elite athletes so can't lay claim to helping Olympians to medals or World Records with their shoes. LUCY'S VERDICT: APPEARANCE . Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape.' The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional. The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty. But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe. Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men. The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them. The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap. The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running. LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL . Adidas: The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock. The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit. Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size. In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit. My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub. Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes. The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running. Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit . Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big. I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better. The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel. Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much. However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair. The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost. Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work. LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT . To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal. I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it. At £19.99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket. The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking. However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type. They can analyse your running style to see if you need any extra support. The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles. Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them. I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the £130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money. I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear. What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology. But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.","Running is often celebrated as a cheap sport to take up .

7638ccd8fff2a7a5c0541faf3b52dbb443845e49,"An apprentice electrician fell off a ladder and died in front of his father after he was electrocuted while testing lights in a factory, an inquest has heard. Nathan Brown, 19, was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane. The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane. He was airlifted to hospital but later died from his injuries. Tragic: Apprentice electrician Nathan Brown died after being electrocuted while testing lights . Accident: Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted, and later died of his injuries . The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps. The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013. Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television. But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests. Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm. Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death . He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection. 'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof. In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located. 'His father was working in the premises at the time. A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft. He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall. 'He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition, although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse.' Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground. His mother Nicole, 47, said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary, who worked at Eurofabs. She told the inquest: 'He said, ""Don't panic mum but Nathan has had a fall."" I remember saying, ""Why, what happened?"" He said, ""He has fallen from a ladder."" 'I asked if he was OK and he said he didn't know as he wasn't conscious. He said, ""You need to get here as soon as you can mum."" I just rushed out the house and got on the car and drove straight over. 'I remember running up the stairs to get to him. I just got more or less up the stairs and I saw the paramedics trying to save him.' Workplace: Nathan and his father were carrying out electrical tests at Eurofabs UK in Rochdale . In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident. He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights. 'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence.' Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT.' He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead. He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking ""danger high voltage"". I have never come across a busbar not sleeved and marked with an appropriate sign. 'Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work. In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident. 'That was the worst and fastest day of my life. It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts. The test he was doing would be as simple as plugging a TV into a wall. 'I'm completely devastated by the accident and life will never be the same again. He was the light of my life and my family and I will miss him so much. Time is a great healer and I hope that will be the case.' The inquest continues.","Nathan Brown, 19, was working with father David testing lights in a factory .

FA chairman Dyke must find £30million to fund his masterplan to reform grassroots football with more 3G pitches in urban coaching hubs, and has identified the non-league national team as an area of potential saving. England C, which has operated under different names since it was formed in 1979, is managed by former Barnet boss Paul Fairclough, who selects from players outside the Football League, aged 23 and under. FA chairman Greg Dyke could axe the England C team to save money to help improve grassroots football . The team normally plays only three or four times a season, but some friendly fixtures have attracted attention inside the organisation because of the elaborate travel involved. England won 6-1 in Bermuda, in June 2013, and won 1-0 in Jordan, in March last year. Fairclough’s team also compete in the International Challenge Trophy, a competition for European semi-pro national teams, but did not qualify for the semi-finals of this year’s tournament from a home-and-away qualifying group featuring Turkey, Slovakia and Estonia. They were beaten by Cyprus U21s in friendly in Larnaca, in February, but there are no more fixtures planned and, since a meeting last week, fears have increased about the long-term future for a team which has been known since its formation as the National Game XI, England Semi-Pro and England Non-League. Paul Fairclough (left) is the current manager of the team and he selects non-league players under 23 . Those capped at this level include George Boyd of Burnley, Craig Mackail-Smith of Brighton and Steve Morison of Leeds, who all went on to play at full international level, although not for England. Boyd and Mackail-Smith won caps for Scotland and Morison for Wales. Former Leicester winger Steve Guppy won one senior England cap after playing once for his country at non-league level. Guppy also won one cap for the U21s and one for England B, which could make him the ultimate one-cap wonder. Barnsley manager Lee Johnson was also capped at non-league level.

But the pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority. Different polls have variously put the Tories and Labour narrowly ahead, with David Cameron and Ed Miliband both facing the prospect of having to rely on smaller parties to form a government. The pound fell to near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 - just after the last election when no party secured a majority . Experts have warned of the impact on the economy of a badly hung parliament, with neither major party able to form a stable government. There are fears it could sent pound plummeting by another 10 per cent. Today’s fall in the value of the pound was also impacted by figures showing industrial production grew by just 0.1 per cent in February. Construction shrank by 0.9 per cent following a 2.5 per cent contraction in January. It was suggested that the figures pointed to overall growth slowing to 0.4 per cent for the first quarter, down from 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2014. That would be the weakest pace of growth since the end of 2013. Labour have made gains in a series of opinion polls, enjoying leads in three and cutting the Conservative lead in another. The latest survey also contains good news for the Liberal Democrats who gain three points to draw level with Ukip for the first time in more than 18 months. Based on the 2010 election result, David Cameron needs to win another 23 more seats to secure a majority in the Commons, while Ed Miliband needs at least  70. Nick Clegg is defending 56 seats, but is braced for heavy losses . ComRes research for ITV and the Daily Mail suggested the race was still too tight to call with the Tories on 34 per cent and Labour on 33 per cent, but that compared with a four-point deficit for Ed Miliband's Opposition at the start of the campaign. Other polls gave Labour leads of between three and six points and one suggested that for the first time voters thought Ed Miliband was doing a better job than David Cameron. The Opposition gained two points on last week in the Survation poll for the Mirror, while the Conservatives dipped one, to move ahead by 35 per cent to 31 per cent. The Labour leader - despite still trailing his Tory rival as the best to be prime minister by 37 per cent to 25 per cent - will be delighted at their latest personal approval ratings after lagging consistently behind throughout most of his leadership. A hard-hitting report by BlackRock, the largest fund manager in the world, said last week that ‘a soothing outcome for the markets is hard to imagine’ given Labour’s anti-business policies and Tory plans to hold a referendum on Britain’ s membership of the European Union. ‘Labour would be tough on business – and might be perceived as lacking fiscal responsibility,’ the US giant said in the report. ‘A Conservatives-dominated Cabinet would pave the way for an unsettling referendum in 2017 on the UK’s EU membership. ‘Whoever wins – and the result could take some time to emerge – will lead a weak government likely to pass only watered-down legislation.’ BlackRock, which invests in major British companies such as Tesco, said weeks of horse-trading to form a government would be ‘harrowing for the UK’.","Pound near 1.46 against the US dollar, its lowest level since June 2010 .

Pictured: NSW police busted an illegal firearm operation in the Casino and Lismore areas last month . Both suburbs saw an increase of almost 500 guns in their areas over the last five years. Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki (pictured) said US's popular national gun laws and pop culture was likely to be driving the increase . Detective Superintendent Mick Plotecki said the United State's popular national gun laws, and the country's influence on Australia through popular culture, was likely to be driving the increase in licence holders in the state. 'There is an element in the community who are swayed by the US culture that guns are a right rather than a privilege,' Supt Plotecki told News Corp. 'Generally speaking however Australians don't have a strong gun culture and recent strong reaction against relaxing our gun ownership laws is indicative of this - Australians don't want lax gun laws'. He added that there did not appear to have been an increase in gun related crime that related to the increase in licences. Although the figures revealed that each person with a licence owns an average of 2.3 guns each, the Firearm Registry's regulations suggest it's not easy to acquire a licence. Each request must include a 'genuine reason', proved through supporting evidence, with each reason in turn holding restrictions on the type of gun that can be owned. Sport, recreational hunting, rural occupation, firearms collection and animal welfare are all listed as 'genuine reasons'.

c1162ae920da18097cca6e8d9520e6d9411037b1,"The body of Kyle Knox has been found near the foot of Ben Nevis three weeks after he disappeared . The body of a missing hiker has been found three weeks after he vanished trying to climb Britain's highest mountain. Kyle Knox, from London, was last seen alive at the foot of Ben Nevis on March 31. The 23-year-old was reported missing the following day when he failed to return to his hotel in Fort William. When he vanished people were being urged not to go to Scotland's mountains unless they had the proper equipment and experience due to the severe weather conditions. The mercury had plunged to minus seven and winds of up to 70mph were recorded in the region. There was also snow on the mountain's peak. It was believed Kyle, who was not an experienced walker, had attempted to climb the Ben Nevis alone. When he set off on the climb Kyle was wearing dark waterproof trousers, walking boots and a jacket with red flashes on it. Searches of Ben Nevis and the Glen Nevis area of Lochaber were launched after the alarm was raised, with Lochaber Mountain Rescue and a RAF search and rescue helicopter from Lossiemouth being scrambled to the scene.

Luke has been missing for two nights in a Victorian national park, with temperatures dropping to as low as eight degree Celsius on Saturday night. However, he may not even know he is lost and is known to frequently hide, according to his family. He was last seen leaving Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park near Lake Eildon at 9.30am on Good Friday. According the Herald Sun, the 11-year-old was reportedly seen walking near the Devils River on Sunday, four kilometres south of his campsite where he was last seen. Search crews have rushed to the location and police remain comfortable that the young boy is still alive. Luke has limited speech and his family says he is probably confused, and he may not even be aware he is lost. Campers are helping rescue teams including the air wing, dog squad, local police and SES volunteers in the search of thick bushland. Scroll down for video . Luke Shambrook was last seen on the national park at 9.30am on Good Friday. It is understood he wandered off and has not been seen since . Police assume Luke has spent 36 hours without food or water and on Saturday night would have experienced temperatures as low as 8 degree Celsius. Police hold hope that Luke has been able to stay reasonably warm as he was last seen wearing a beanie and warm jacket. There was a moment of hope when a beanie was found by the search party, however it was decided it did not belong to Luke. Having met Luke's family during a push to open a special school in Melbourne's southeast, Opposition emergency services spokeman Brad Battin says it's devastating to hear the 11-year-old is missing. He says Luke's parents Tim and Rachel have been updating him on the search and appreciate the efforts of all those out looking for their little boy. 'He's a lovely young kid,' Mr Battin told AAP on Sunday. 'He displays all the characteristics of a child with autism, which means he might not even think he is lost.' Sergeant Greg Paul says the search is focused on an area of several kilometres of bushland. The Candlebark Campground in Fraser National Park, central Victoria, where Luke went missing on Friday . 'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush, we've got a lot searchers searching all the tracks and in between the tracks and the gullies and the spurs,' he told reporters on Saturday. The Shambrook family has thanked emergency service workers, volunteers, family and friends for their help. They say the disappearance is completely out of character for him.

'We've got a lot of searchers in the bush,' he told reporters on Saturday. 'We've also got people walking the banks of the lake.' But he outlined a serious hurdle for the search efforts, according to ABC. 'With the autistic condition, Luke might not respond to searchers, he may not even know that he's lost,' he said. 'He won't necessarily respond to his name being called, but that might change a little bit as he gets hungry maybe.

The family of Lavall Hall, released the shocking video which calls into question the Miami Gardens police department's account of the incident on February 15. The clip captured from the police car at the scene shows shell cases flying as a police officer shot the 25-year-old schizophrenic, who was black, on February 15. The police department said the officers were forced to shoot because Hall 'attacked' them with 'deadly force' using the broom - but the video footage appears to show him trying to flee the officers before he was fatally shot. Footage captured from within a police car at the scene show shell cases flying as police officer Eddie Trimino fatally shot schizophrenic 25-year-old Lavall Hall, who was black, outside his home in Miami Gardens . Attorneys for Hall's family released the 19 minutes of dash-cam video yesterday afternoon at a press conference and claim it shows Hall was being chased by police before he was shot at five times. Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week earlier and was suffering from a psychotic episode when his mother, Catherine Daniels, called police to take him to a mental health unit, reports Fusion. Hall's family have now filed a wrongful death lawsuit  in federal court in Miami against the city of Miami Gardens and the two police officers, Peter Ehrlich and Eddo Trimino. According to the complaint Ms Daniels had previously called police for help with her son, and the department was aware of his condition, alleging excessive use of force by police and wrongful death. An officer can be heard shouting 'Get on the f****** ground or you're dead' on the police car footage . Hall, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, had been released from a mental hospital just one week before the shooting . The footage shot from inside the car appears to show Hall running past the car with two officers in pursuit . 'Hall was unable to communicate, clearly did not understand what was going on, and was visibly scared,' it said. Two of the five bullets fired hit Hall Miami Gardens police told reporters in the days after the incident - explaining that Hall had attacked officers with the broom. But Hall's lawyers argue that the police used 'excessive force' after he ran away from them. His lawyers said Hall was holding the broomstick and dressed only in his underpants but the video shows he can be seen running from the police. Ms Daniels said at a news conference yesterday: 'I never thought they [were] going to kill my child, murder my child,' adding she was 'devastated' when she first saw the video. Catherine Daniels, Lavall's mother, is hugged by her cousin Alfonzo Hill at the news conference yesterday . 'He was standing outside just holding the broomstick in his hand,' Daniels said. 'And I told him, 'Baby, come back inside, it's cold.' As the video played at the news conference, one of the attorneys for the family said Ms Daniels can be heard telling police before the shooting, 'Please don't hurt my child, please' ABC news reported. Her attorney added: 'The officers had made up their minds that they were going to kill Lavall before this incident took place.' 'They killed him, murdered him,' said Melissa Edwards, the mother of Hall's daughter, at the news conference. An attorney for Eddo Trimino, the officer involved, told the Miami Herald the video indicated that the officer had shot out of fear. The lawyer for the officers argues they acted appropriately and claims Hall attacked them with deadly force . The video was released amid national protests over a series of deaths resulting from police use of force, most recently with another video showing a white South Carolina police officer shooting an apparently unarmed black man in the back. 'People are saddened and angered but also exasperated that we're again seeing the devaluation of black lives on streets of the United States,' said Muhammed Malik, organizer of the Miami Committee on State Violence. A spokesman for Florida State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told ABC News that the investigation is ongoing but they have concerns the video may endanger the investigation. Oscar Marrero, attorney for the officers, told ABC News: 'The officers were faced with a dangerous situation. 'They have already given statements to investigators indicating Mr. Hall struck them with a weapon and deadly force was used. 'The reasonableness of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene. The reliable evidence will establish Officers Trimino and Ehrlich acted appropriately.'","Lavall Hall, 25, was suffering psychotic episode when fatally shot by police .

30d677eb679d52fe11e5dd4deeb37c811f4a3bca,"Mobile phones and tablet computers are becoming dangerous distractions for parents who are supposed to be supervising their children, researchers claim. A study found youngsters were more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them were distracted – with texting or talking on the phone a common cause. Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York. Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first. Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way. The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first and found children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way . Electronic devices such as mobile phones were responsible for 30 per cent of all parental distractions. Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt. Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children’s Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: ‘Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered.’ A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work . Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world. Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist . She said: 'One vital fact I have learnt is that the brain is not the unchanging organ that we might imagine. 'It not only goes on developing, changing and, in some tragic cases, eventually deteriorating with age, it is also substantially shaped by what we do to it and by the experience of daily life. When I say ""shaped"", I'm not talking figuratively or metaphorically; I'm talking literally. At a microcellular level, the infinitely complex network of nerve cells that make up the constituent parts of the brain actually change in response to certain experiences and stimuli.' The brain, in other words, is malleable - not just in early childhood but right up to early adulthood, and, in certain instances, beyond. The surrounding environment has a huge impact both on the way our brains develop and how that brain is transformed into a unique human mind. Of course, there's nothing new about that: human brains have been changing, adapting and developing in response to outside stimuli for centuries. But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically. 'This will affect our brains over the next 100 years in ways we might never have imagined,' she said. 'Our brains are under the influence of an ever- expanding world of new technology: multichannel television, video games, MP3 players, the internet, wireless networks, Bluetooth links - the list goes on and on. 'This games-driven generation interpret the world through screen-shaped eyes. It's almost as if something hasn't really happened until it's been posted on Facebook, Bebo or YouTube. 'We could be raising a hedonistic generation who live only in the thrill of the computer-generated moment, and are in distinct danger of detaching themselves from what the rest of us would consider the real world.' 'Electronic devices and pharmaceutical drugs all have an impact on the micro- cellular structure and complex biochemistry of our brains. And that, in turn, affects our personality, our behaviour and our characteristics. In short, the modern world could well be altering our human identity.'","Researchers observed random parents with children at NY playgrounds .

cdf27c4ae412a4b9b5841d2e31d4d8c8314c80ee,"Nine council workers have been sacked for inappropriately accessing confidential social work files on tragic toddler Mikaeel Kular. The three-year-old was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya, who beat him for being sick and left him to die in agony for three days before hiding his body in a suitcase and dumping it in woods. She then told police the boy had wandered off, sparking a huge manhunt before eventually leading officers to the body near Kirkcaldy in Fife, in January last year. Scroll down for video . Victim: Fife council workers looked at Mikaeel Kular's (left) confidential files after he was killed by his mother Rosdeep Adekoya (right) Police Scotland probed the claims and an internal investigation was launched by Fife Council last year when up to 25 staff were alleged to have accessed confidential social work files belonging to the youngster. It has now been revealed at least nine workers were subject to disciplinary action and subsequently dismissed after looking at documents relating to the high-profile case without permission. Adekoya, who had frequently left her children home alone to go to nightclubs and take cocaine, was jailed for 11 years in August last year but could be free within seven. She repeatedly beat her son before putting his lifeless body in a suitcase and leaving it in woodland behind her sister's home. Investigations found her internet history included searches 'I find it hard to love my son', 'I love all of my children except one', 'why am I so aggressive with my son' and 'get rid of bruises'. Five thousand local residents signed a petition protesting against the failure of prosecutors to pursue a murder charge against her. Social services were also widely criticised for failing Mikaeel after it emerged he was twice taken into care by social workers. At the time of the trial, the court was told how Fife social services monitored Adekoya and her young family until December 2013 – the month before Mikaeel's death. Tragic: Scores of tributes were left near to the youngster's home in Edinburgh following a massive search to find him . Grim discovery: The three-year-old's body was found in woodland behind his auntie's house in Fife . However, Adekoya was not on the radar of social workers in Edinburgh, despite having moved to the Scottish capital. Craig Munro, Executive Director of Education and Children's Services at Fife council said: . 'We have a clear internal process for dealing with discipline issues and we don't comment publicly on the individual circumstances of staff.' A seperate investigation into whether Mikaeel's death could have been prevented is due to be published in a matter of weeks. Police Scotland said they would not be taking the matter further. A spokesman said: 'No criminal complaint had been made so we consider it an internal matter for Fife Council.'","Fife Council launched internal investigation following accusations .

57bad62c610754c019aaceed38930ba07cdf1656,"Rape: Edwin 'Jock' Mee is accused of attacking several Army cadets while working as a recruitment sergeant . An Army recruiting sergeant raped a teenage cadet after telling her he could help her get a visa from the Home Office, a court heard today. Edwin 'Jock' Mee allegedly told the 18-year-old, from Sierra Leone, that her visa application had been delayed in order to persuade her to have sex with him. He is accused of carrying out sex attacks on 11 victims as young as 15 while working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, between October 2010 and September 2011. One woman told Southwark Crown Court today that she saw Mee, 46, as a father figure after he helped her join the Army. She said: 'He was like someone I could really lean on because, going for some interviews with him, he would ask me everything about my personal life, everything, because he said that is the procedure they need to do. 'So it is like I took him as a father, or someone I can relate to, or maybe understand what is happening to me.' Jurors heard that Mee repeatedly asked the teenager if she wanted to have sex with him - she initially ignored him, but later explicitly told him she did not want to do. The court heard that one occasion when she went to see Mee, he slapped her bottom as she left the office, and she told him 'never do that'. Prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC asked the woman why she did not tell any of the other recruiters what was going on. The witness replied: 'He always told me not to say anything to anyone because no one will believe me and looking at him, and his status, all these things, I believed him.' Describing the alleged rape, the woman said she had gone in for her final Army selection interview in August 2011 before the conclusion of the process. Around the same time she was trying to renew her visa with the Home Office, and was not aware of any problems with the application before she went to see Mee. She said: 'He said there was a delay for me to pay the money, that if the visa didn't come, I can't go for selection and my date was already fixed. He told me he can help me. 'He told me that because I need to go to selection and my passport was with the Home Office, and he told me that he was going to help and I said, ""How are you going to do that?"" He just said, ""A call that I can make,"" and I said ""Why don't you do it?"" 'He said: ""You know what you can do that will make me do it.""' Base: Mee was working at an Army careers centre in Croydon, south London, pictured . The court heard that Mee then told the woman to wait for the 'boss' who was going to conduct her interview. But he returned a short time later, told her that he would now be talking to her and took her to the kitchen area, jurors were told. Dressed in his Army uniform, Mee allegedly spoke to the woman about her selection procedure and the fact her passport was with the Home Office, before leaving her waiting alone again. The woman said: 'He came back and sat, he started asking me if I was going to have sex with him.' Jurors heard that she told Mee 'no' and that she was simply there to see the 'boss', still believing that there were other people in the recruitment office. When he asked her for sex again he allegedly said that no one would ever know, and later revealed that there was nobody left in the office. The woman told the court that Mee then 'jumped' and kissed her on the lips, before asking her to lift up her skirt and show him her underwear. He then pounced on the woman and began assaulting her, before she told him that she could not breathe. 'I was suffocating because he was on top of me,' the woman said. 'And I told him that I was suffocating, he got scared a bit and that is when he jumped off me, because I wasn't breathing.' After the incident Mee drove the woman home, telling her not to tell anyone what had happened, and said that he was helping her out, the court heard. The woman said she kept quiet about what happened because he was 'a big person in the Army' and she did not think anyone would believe her. Jurors heard that soon afterwards, the alleged victim received a letter from the Home Office saying her visa had been granted, and she thought Mee had been responsible for this. Sergeant: Mee denies assaulting the women between 2010 and 2011 . Mee, who now lives in Scotland, denies 17 counts of sexual assault, three rapes and one count of assault by penetration. Jurors also heard that the woman kept a diary in which she wrote entries about her daily life. Writing about the day she was allegedly raped, she said: 'Jock also got a message from the Home Office that they are not going to grant me the extension because I was late to pay the money. 'Jock had to beg for me and he also sent them a letter to appeal on my behalf. I am so thankful to God that Jock helped me out in that. He has always been there for me, if they don't agree he said he will marry me. LOL. 'That is so sweet of him. God, please don't let anything happen to me.' In cross-examination Lisa Wilding QC asked the woman if Mee had offered to marry her 'jokingly or seriously'. 'That is why I put LOL because that is what I thought, because he is telling me all these things that I wasn't aware of,' she replied. In another entry a few days later, she thanked the sergeant for helping her with her application to remain in the UK. She wrote: 'I also thank Jock for making that call to the Home Office. He helped me a lot. If he didn't call, they should have refused me.' Asked why she hadn't told anyone of the rape, the woman explained that she was like an abused child. She said: 'He is just like a father who is abusing a child and the child doesn't know that you are abusing it, and you are torn between love and hate. That is how I felt.' The trial continues.

6721edf88c95f480a4db2c63649dbb03736aeadf,"A teacher has been banned from the classroom after he let pupils change their exam answers invalidating his whole school's SATs results. Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher’s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick’s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel’s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction.

It just happens,' he says. His 30-yard propellor kick for Sweden against England is rated by Steven Gerrard as the greatest goal he's ever seen. To be fair, Ibrahimovic's CV allows him plenty of bragging rights. The Swede with Bosnian roots has played for Ajax, Juventus, Barcelona and both Milan giants. He once won eight league titles in a row. Not bad for a poor kid whose immigrant parents moved to the roughest part of Malmo. Now he's trying to make new history with PSG. He was the marquee signing when Qatari owners bought the Paris side and decided to try and turn it into Europe's greatest football club. They agreed to pay him £200,000-a-week, even though France's 75 per cent top tax rate meant their total bill would be close to £50million a year. Not that Ibrahimovic is that overly grateful. He recently called France a 's**t country' and had to apologise in a rare burst of self-awareness. Despite domestic dominance, Champions League glory has remained elusive so far. Ibrahimovic has never won the trophy as a player, and his bad luck in the competition continued when he was harshly sent off in the previous round against Chelsea and was therefore suspended for the first leg against Barca. Ibrahimovic is PSG's main attraction and will take centre stage against his old club Barcelona on Tuesday . The former Barcelona striker jumps for joy after scoirng against Bastia in the French League Cup final . Ibrahimovic, pictured celebrating with Marquinhos, will be convinced that PSG can progress against Barca . For Paris to pull off one of European football's greatest comebacks, Zlatan and Marco Verratti will have to excel. Ibrahimovic undoubtedly has the talent to produce a flash of brilliance or two to put Luis Enrique's men under pressure. His balletic left-footed back heel while on the rise for Sweden against Italy at Euro 2004 was a goal very few players could have scored. His famous strike against England silenced those who wondered why he could never produce against British clubs. Against Barcelona, Ibra will have special motivation. He spent a season at the Nou Camp in 2009/10. It should have been the perfect stage for his talents but he moved to Inter Milan after just a year. Ibrahimovic spent just one season at the Nou Camp before moving to Serie A giants Inter Milan . He felt Messi's insistence on playing more centrally inhibited his own game and that coach Pep Guardiola wasn't strong enough to devise a system that could incorporate both of them. He called Guardiola a 'spineless coward' after Barcelona were beaten by Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan in the Champions League. Ibrahimovic made his point by scoring for Paris in Barcelona in a group game earlier this season. But this is the big one. Nobody will give him a chance – except for Zlatan himself.","Zlatan Ibrahimovic will line up against former club Barcelona on Tuesday .

5cf4682cd03238d5867027ce9492b626cd1ed011,"Jameela spent £3,000 on having all her amalgam fillings removed and replaced with white fillings . Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model. Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years. 'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4. 'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted. Occasionally, I would even faint. There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible.' After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests. Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body. In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury. After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child. So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings. Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain. Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust. It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper. Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together. Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors. Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys. But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. 'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says. Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour. This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine. Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause . But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins. Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser. Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire. It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley. And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk. Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out. This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases. A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition. But fillings aren't the only source of mercury. It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people. However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin. Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week. And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk . But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet. She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye. Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels. With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause. 'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela. But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years. 'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says. 'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system. 'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system.' Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues. But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this. 'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue. So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says. The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth . Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day. These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it. She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill. 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says. 'It took about a year before I started to feel better. It's all had a massive impact on my life.' However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way. 'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says. 'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings. 'In fact, I see patients whose gut symptoms, ironically, seem to be caused by the stress and anxiety of thinking that it is their mercury fillings which are causing stomach problems, when there is no physical sign of any gut disorders.' But Jameela remains convinced that the mercury was the cause of her problems. 'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings. I know I feel much better now,' she says. Private clinics offer mercury testing. But Dr Mahendra says anyone thinking of having this done should check that the clinic's laboratories have clinical pathology accreditation (CPA) to ensure that the tests are carried out properly.

3815d19af18ff22be6ad6095722d7367bb7271af,"A paramedic who pretended he was gay to get close to women before sexually assaulting them has been struck off the medical register. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire, attacked three women after separate drinking sessions and was jailed for 12 years after being convicted of rape and four other abuse charges last year. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee today removed him from the register after hearing his crimes and describing them as 'a serious breach of trust'. Christopher Bridger, 25, who was jailed for 12 years after he sexually assaulted three women, has been struck off the medical register . A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of raping a fellow student while he was studying to be a paramedic at St George's University Hospital in London in 2008. He had accompanied her back to her halls following a Freshers' Week fancy dress party and began kissing and cuddling her, despite being told to stop. He then raped her but astonishingly broke down in tears afterwards and said: 'I just want to like girls.' The woman told the jury she ended up comforting Bridger, despite knowing he was in the wrong. His other victims were co-workers at South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust, where he started working in 2010. A lesbian colleague told the court she was molested by Bridger after a staff Christmas party while her girlfriend was in the same hotel bed. The HCPC Conduct and Competence Committee found his crimes were a 'serious breach of trust' The women, aged in their 20s - who cannot be named for legal reasons - were forced to relive their ordeals after the ambulance worker accused them of lying during a trial in July last year. His colleague explained how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party in December 2011. He climbed into bed between his victim and her partner and the woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened, but the day after on his birthday, he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay at her house after a dinner in October 2012. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Services bosses in 2012. He was jailed for 12 years and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders' Register for life but failed to attend today's medical register hearing. Striking him off, chair of the HCPC panel, Nicola Bastin said: 'The panel has heard that the offences were committed against three vulnerable young women who were known to the registrant as friends and colleagues including a student paramedic. This represented a serious breach of trust. 'The panel has also heard that the women were vulnerable due to the effects of alcohol and that one of the offences was committed when the woman was asleep. 'The panel has considered this case very carefully and cannot find any redeeming features on the part of the registrant. A jury at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey, found him guilty of rape and four other sex abuse charges . 'The panel takes the view that this case is serious, it does indeed involve abuse of trust, sexual abuse of a serious nature and, furthermore, there is no evidence of insight on the part of the registrant.' The HCPC panel chairman Brian Wroe added: 'The registrant entered a plea of not guilty to each of the charges and was found guilty following a 13 day trial. 'This showed Christopher Bridger lacks the insight into the circumstances which resulted in the convictions and does not take responsibility for his actions.' When he was sentenced in September, Mr Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith told him: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time.'","Christopher Bridger, 25, attacked three women after drinking sessions .

Silva was substituted in the defeat by Barcelona in midweek and the injury is still keeping him out . 'Game Ready', as seen being used by Thiago Silva, is a cold therapy compression system used to treat sports injuries. It circulates cold water around the injury, cooling it down with the aim to bring players back from injury as soon as possible. He posted an update on Instagram, writing: 'Guys, I'm here to thank you all for your prayers!

PSG coach Laurent Blanc said on Friday: 'Thiago Silva is out for Nice even if his injury is not as bad as first feared.' The game against Nice comes more than 24 hours before league leaders Lyon face a tough task at home against fifth-place St Etienne. A win in south east France would put the French champions a point clear of their closest rivals. Lyon could take back top spot on Sunday but Blanc's side will have a game in hand at the close of the weekend. 'It is not easy to prepare for this match,' Blanc said. 'We must turn in up in championship mode. In this final stretch, we no longer have room for error.' Laurent Blanc said that Silva's injury is not as bad as first feared, and that was confirmed by the Brazilian .

d25d52c434a13c1df5faa593e8a097d2f501a2b6,"(CNN)You know the phrase ""dodging a bullet""? Forget about it. Probably not going to happen anymore. The U.S. military said this week it has made great progress in its effort to develop a self-steering bullet. In February, the ""smart bullets"" -- .50-caliber projectiles equipped with optical sensors -- passed their most successful round of live-fire tests to date, according to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the tests, an experienced marksman ""repeatedly hit moving and evading targets,"" a DARPA statement said. ""Additionally,"" the statement said, ""a novice shooter using the system for the first time hit a moving target."" In other words, now you don't even have to be a good shot to hit the mark. The system has been developed by DARPA's Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance program, known as EXACTO. ""True to DARPA's mission, EXACTO has demonstrated what was once thought impossible: the continuous guidance of a small-caliber bullet to target,"" said Jerome Dunn, DARPA program manager. ""This live-fire demonstration from a standard rifle showed that EXACTO is able to hit moving and evading targets with extreme accuracy at sniper ranges unachievable with traditional rounds. Fitting EXACTO's guidance capabilities into a small .50-caliber size is a major breakthrough and opens the door to what could be possible in future guided projectiles across all calibers,"" Dunn said. Videos supplied by DARPA show the bullets making sharp turns in midair as they pursue their targets. It all conjures up images of a cartoon character frantically fleeing a bullet that follows him wherever he goes. Only, these bullets are traveling at hundreds of miles per hour. And even the Road Runner can't run that fast. DARPA says the smart bullets will also help shooters who are trying, for example, to hit targets in high winds. The goals of the EXACTO program are giving shooters accuracy at greater distances, engaging targets sooner and enhancing the safety of American  troops, DARPA said.",".50-caliber bullets equipped with optical sensors can follow moving targets .

Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me. I don't need to order from catalogues any more. 'I feel fantastic and I look great. I have a new life now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fry-up with four slices of buttered bread .

EasyJet and BA are among a host of major airlines expected to scrap hundreds of flights thanks to the walk-out, which will start at 5am tomorrow and run for 48 hours - with considerable knock-on disruption expected. Experts fear up to half of all flights between the UK and France could be axed, depending on how strongly the strike holds. Delays: easyJet is one of many airlines set to cancel flights over a strike by French air traffic controllers over the next three days (file photo) Families returning from their Easter holidays and those hoping for a last-minute break will be worst affected. EasyJet is cancelling 118 flights to and from France, including 10 which either start or finish at British airports. A spokesman said: 'EasyJet has been advised of planned industrial strike action by French air traffic control services on April 8 and government transport workers on April 9. Like all airlines flying to and from France, we expect significant impact to our flights during this period, including cancellations.' The cancelled services include return flights between Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Gatwick, Paris and Luton, Gatwick and Toulouse, plus flights between Gatwick and Spain. The airline urged all passengers going to France to check the status of their flight online before they travel. British Airways said it was cancelling around a dozen return flights from the UK. A  spokesman said: 'Early indications are that there will be significant disruption for all airlines who fly within, to and from France and who also use French airspace for over flights. 'We are doing all we can to minimise disruption to customers flying to and from France as a result of the threatened air traffic control strike. 'Unfortunately there will be some knock-on delays to other parts of our short-haul network as a result of the strike action, given how much airspace in Europe will be affected. We are sorry for any disruption to customers' travel plans.' Flybe said it was cancelling 16 flights including services to Paris from Manchester, Birmingham and Exeter as well as some flights from Southampton. Adding to the possible chaos, tomorrow is the first day of a new regultion which forces travel operators to check the passports of all passengers leaving Britain and pass on their details to the Home Office. Chaos: Charles de Gaulle Airport, pictured, and other French hubs will be severely affected by the strike . The strike has been called because the French air traffic union says their controllers are expected to retire later than their counterparts elsewhere in western Europe. The walk-out is one of a series planned this month, with more industrial action from April 16 to 18 and another walk-out between April 29 and May 2. Plans for the original strike on March 25 were suspended after the fatal Germanwings crash in the French Alps. European air traffic chiefs at Eurocontrol have also warned of 'a significant risk of disruption', with the number of flights from France's busiest airport down 40 per cent tomorrow and 50 per cent on Thursday. National carrier Air France, based at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside Paris, is expected to be hardest hit. Air France said up to 40 per cent of its medium haul flights to and from Paris CDG will be cancelled. Rregional subsidiary HOP! will axe two thirds of its flights to and from Orly airport, and 40 per cent of services at other French airports. Britain's National Air Traffic Services, which controls the airspace over the UK, said: 'We've spoken to our operational teams and much will depend on the severity of the strike and how the airlines choose to respond in terms of their schedules. 'If it follows previous patterns we can expect a lot of airlines requesting to re-route around French airspace. That shifts the traffic from our usually very busy south coast airspace sectors to the west (Lands End) and east (Clacton and Dover).' A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said passengers affected by the strike would not receive compensation as strike action is classed as an 'unforeseen circumstance' outside the control of airlines. But they will be entitled to food, drink and, if necessary, hotel accommodation. Ryanair said it was cancelling more than 250 flights with more likely, branding the strike 'grossly unfair'. Ryanair is cancelling more than 250 flights, with a spokesman branding the strike action as 'grossly unfair' A spokesman for the budget airline said: 'Ryanair regrets to inform customers that it has been forced to cancel over 250 flights on Wednesday due to a French Air Traffic Control strike. 'Further cancellations and delays are likely and customers should check the status of their flight before leaving for the airport on the Ryanair.com website, where the latest information will be published. We sincerely apologise to all customers affected by this unwarranted strike action and we call on the EU and French authorities to take measures to prevent any further disruption. 'It's grossly unfair that thousands of European travellers will once again have their travel plans disrupted by the selfish actions of a tiny number of French Air traffic Control workers.

But Ronaldo, 30, doesn't only have the status of Raul or Di Stefano to look up to, but also Barcelona rival Lionel Messi, who is younger, and seemingly still improving.

Lionel Messi is closing in on the 400 mark with Barcelona and should rapidly rise up the scoring charts . 7) Zico, Flamengo (1971-83 and 1985-89) 401 . An attacking midfielder in the top 10? Often called the 'White Pele', Zico encapsulated a fine generation of Brazilian football, and impressed with his club side in his homeland. Over two spells with Flamengo, it's no wonder he was given a prestigious nickname. Zico of Flamengo takes on Liverpool's (l-r) Ray Kennedy, Graeme Souness and Alan Hansen in a friendly . 6) Eusebio, Benfica (1960-75) 474 . Eusebio helped Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies, as well as four European Cup finals. Not just a poacher, Eusebio had it all and the Mozambique-born player was a Portuguese football legend. Eusebio lead Benfica to 11 league titles and seven more domestic trophies with a staggering amount of goals . 5) Uwe Seeler, Hamburg (1953-72) 507 . Up there with Gerd Muller and Franz Beckenbauer as a German great, Seeker was not a giant but a very strong player with fantastic shooting and heading abilities. His tally probably proves that. Uwe Seeler scored over 500 goals for Hamburg and is up there with Franz Beckenbauer as a German great . 4) Jimmy McGrory, Celtic (1922-37) 522 . Regarded as the Hoops' finest ever player, McGrory netted 55 hat-tricks for the club and went on to rewrite the football record books with his unbelievable scoring feats. 3) Josef Bican, Slavia Prague (1937-48) 534 . Slavia were one of the biggest clubs in the pre-war era, led by a striker from a poor family, brought up in Austria. He fled to Czechoslovakia during the second world war, and certainly made his mark. 2) Gerd Muller, Bayern Munich (1964-79) 573 . Muller scored an incredible 85 goals in a single season as Bayern Munich claimed the Bundesliga title in 1972, and was the league's top scorer on seven occasions. Muller spent 13 campaigns with the Bavarian giants and with his goalscoring record, it's no wonder to see him near the top of the charts. Gerd Muller (centre) scored 85 goals in one league season with Bayern Munich and netted 573 in total . 1) Pele, Santos (1956-74) 1088 . Though his official record stands at 643 goals for Brazilian side Santos, and the 1088 includes strikes against a military XI, Pele tops the charts. Is he the best player of all-time, too? Pele unofficially scored 1088 goals for Santos and is widely regarded as the best player of all-time . PS... who are these Premier League sides' all-time top scorers? ARSENAL . 228 - Thierry Henry (1999-2007 and 2012) 185 - Ian Wright (1991-98) 178 - Cliff Bastin (1929-47) Thierry Henry enjoyed a prolific eight-year spell with Arsenal and is the club's all-time top goalscorer . CHELSEA . 211 - Frank Lampard (2001-14) 202 - Bobby Tambling (1959-70) 193 - Kerry Dixon (1983-92) EVERTON . 383 - Dixie Dean (1925-37) 159 - Graeme Sharp (1980-91) 138 - Bob Latchford (1974-81) LIVERPOOL . 346 - Ian Rush (1980-87 and 1988-96) 286 - Roger Hunt (1958-69) 241 - Gordon Hodgson (1925-36) Ian Rush netted 346 times over two spells with Liverpool and is streaks ahead of anyone else in the charts .

929791869be6c996e8d9f14626c30f157ed9ed59,"The stage was set for the coronation of King Jimmy on Tuesday but West Indies stubbornly refused to hurry him to his throne. The perfect script for this first Test saw Anderson taking the four wickets he needed to become the most prolific bowler in England’s history in his 100th game with record holder Sir Ian Botham here and waiting to crown his successor. But West Indies made Anderson wait on an attritional day that was in sharp contrast to the excitement provided by the first of this crucial series. Certainly Anderson would not have expected to play a more significant role with bat than ball on the second day of this first Test as West Indies did much to make up for their profligacy in the last two sessions of the first. When Anderson, watched by his wife, two daughters and parents, strode out to bat England had lost five wickets for 20 runs and were in danger of wasting the initiative handed to them largely by Ian Bell’s century. But ‘the Burnley Lara’, of course, is a more than useful No 11 these days and came within 19 runs of a Test century at Trent Bridge last year, so it should not have been a surprise to see him sticking around with Chris Jordan. When the pair were separated after a last-wicket stand of 38 England had moved to within a run of the score of 400 that should have been their minimum target when they were well placed on 341 for four on the first evening. Then it was a question of whether this unassuming Lancastrian could move from 380 wickets to 384 and overtake Botham, who was on hand apparently with a nice bottle of red wine waiting to celebrate, at the top of England’s Test tree. Only it was not quite as simple as that. Modern Test pitches in the Caribbean are notoriously slow and turgid and it was never going to be a case of simply sitting back and waiting for a West Indian collapse. Jimmy Anderson (right) is still three wickets away from breaking Sir Ian Botham's England record . Ben Stokes was England's first man to be dismissed on day two when he edged to Jason Holder in the slips . Jerome Taylor celebrates dismissing Stokes to take West Indies' first wicket of the day in Antigua . James Tredwell edges a delivery from Holder behind as he is dismissed for eight . Anderson had surprisingly chosen to bowl from the Curtly Ambrose End where the strong cross-wind that blows across this ground would in theory assist in-swing more than his more dangerous out-swinger. But Anderson, who had led England out on to the field in his landmark Test, generally knows what he is doing and successfully targeted the outside edge of the left-handed Devon Smith’s bat with a beauty. It was to prove his only success of a frustrating day. Anderson could make no further inroads and was surprisingly limited to just four overs after tea as the other England bowlers were forced to share the load and three more wickets. Jordan had looked good in making an unbeaten 21 and now he was to again prove himself an all-round cricketer of rich but raw promise, taking the wicket of Darren Bravo and later claiming an outstanding diving slip catch off James Tredwell to send back his old Barbados schoolmate Kraigg Brathwaite. Stuart Broad, who has not been at his best since returning from injury at the World Cup, had earlier ended Marlon Samuels hopes of extending his purple patch against England and West Indies were on the back foot at 99 for four. Jos Buttler fell for a duck despite facing 22 deliveries on the second morning at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . West Indies fast bowler celebrates after dismissing Buttler for a duck on day two of the first Test . Stuart Broad was England's ninth wicket to fall before Anderson fell for 20 with the score on 399 . Anderson celebrates after seeing Devon Smith edge behind to Buttler to take England's first wicket . Buttler makes the catch from Anderson's bowling to dismiss Smith for 11 and leave West Indies 19 for one . Yet the evergreen Shiv Chanderpaul, who could easily have gone to his first ball, settled in to his old idiosyncratic routine and hung on to the close with the far less secure Jermaine Blackwood, who had a major escape when Stokes had him well caught at slip only to be denied because he had over-stepped. Stokes has previous in this regard, having been denied his maiden Test wicket in Adelaide when he snared Brad Haddin only to overstep again and there is simply no excuse to lose a wicket in this way. The Durham hot-head was clearly ticking afterwards and it can only be hoped that he did not encounter any lockers when he returned to the dressing room, having broken his wrist punching one in Barbados last year. West Indies finished on 155 for four having had the better of the second day and leaving England with much to do if they are to secure the win here that would be so important to them. West Indies were batting earlier than expected because of a poor performance from England in the morning as they replicated their struggles of the first session of the match and crumbled against good pace bowling. Chris Jordan celebrates after dismissing Darren Bravo, who edged behind to Buttler, for 10 . Broad celebrates dismissing Marlon Samuels for 33 to leave West Indies on 89 for three . Tredwell celebrates after seeing Jordan hold onto a catch at first slip to dismiss Kraigg Brathwaite . Stokes was perfectly placed to score his second Test hundred but once he had steered Jerome Taylor straight to gully England worryingly had no answer to what remains a more than useful West Indies pace trio. Most disturbing of all was the performance of Broad, who was once a good enough batsman to score a Test hundred at Lord’s against Pakistan. Now he looks a shadow of a player once thought of as a potential No 7 for England and again looked like he had been affected by being hit in the face by India’s Varun Aaron at Old Trafford last summer. Broad was honest enough to admit during the World Cup that he had had nightmares about the incident that left his nose broken but he was also confident that he was getting back to his best with the bat. It did not seem that way here as he ducked a couple of short balls from Kemar Roach and then, caught on the back foot, slapped a fuller ball to gully. When he fell and England had slumped to 361 for nine the Test was back in the balance but Anderson and Jordan kept England’s noses in front until the wait for Anderson’s big moment began. We are all still waiting. England, meanwhile, should confirm on Wednesday that Moeen Ali will join the squad in time for the second Test in Grenada after successfully coming through his return after injury with Worcestershire. It could mean that Adil Rashid, disappointing in the warm-up in St Kitts, is released to return to Yorkshire, who have been frustrated by the sight of four of their players being in the England party but not included in this first Test.","West Indies reach 155 for four at stumps on day two of first Test .

d07fd09ea28118a9090a0b5eea0bda0f33456cb0,"Actress Jemima Kirke has revealed details about her experience with abortion, admitting that she was forced to use up every penny of her savings in order to pay for the procedure. The 29-year-old actress made the admission in a newly-released PSA for the Center of Reproductive Rights, an organization which aims to advance reproductive freedom, in the hopes that her story will help to encourage women to be more open and honest about the taboo topic. 'In 2007 I became pregnant with my boyfriend at the time,' she says in the video, which appears on the website for the center's Draw the Line campaign. 'My life just wasn't conducive to raising a happy, healthy child. I just didn't think it was fair. So I decided to get an abortion, and I went to Planned Parenthood.' Scroll down for video . Abortion advocate: Girls actress Jemima Kirke, 29, spoke out about her abortion in a new PSA for the Center for Reproductive Rights . Costly procedure: Jemima says she needed her boyfriend's help to pay for the procedure, and even then she could not afford anesthesia . While she was able to easily access the local clinic in Providence, Rhode Island, where she went to school, Jemima says she faced numerous other hurdles to obtain her legal abortion. 'Because I couldn't tell my mother that I was pregnant, I had to pay for it out of pocket,' she explains. 'I did have to like, empty my checking account, what I had in there, and get some from my boyfriend. 'I realized that if I didn’t take the anesthesia, I would be able to afford to do this. The anesthesia wasn’t that much more, but when you’re scrounging for however many hundreds of dollars, it is a lot. I just didn't have it.' Jemima says that it's obstacles like these that have made her want to speak out publicly about reproductive rights. '[Abortions are] not completely unavailable, and that's the tricky part,' she says. 'We do have free choice, we are able to do whatever we want, but then there are these little hoops we have to jump through to get them.' Speaking out: The actress says getting an abortion was the right decision for her at the time, and she has since given birth to a daughter named Rafella Israel Mosberg . It is not the first time that Jemima has used her own experience in order to raise awareness about abortions; in a 2012 episode of HBO series Girls, Jemima's character Jessa had a pregnancy scare and booked herself in for an abortion. While she eventually realized that she wasn't actually pregnant, the episode touched on some of the scarier realities that many young women have to face when placed in a similar situation. In reality, women have to jump through numerous 'hoops' before they can undergo the procedure, including lack of health insurance coverage for abortion, legal impediments, and limited access to facilities that offer the procedure in some states. According to the Guttmacher Institue, 33 per cent of women who obtained abortions in 2008 did not have health insurance; of the 66 per cent of women who did have health insurance, 57 per cent paid for the procedure out of pocket. There are difficulties even for women who can afford to pay; from 2011 to 2013, more laws restricting abortion were passed than during the entire previous decade, including gestational limits, state-mandating counseling, and waiting periods. Bold show: In the first season of Girls, Jemima's character Jessa schedules an abortion but doesn't go through with it; her character later has a miscarriage . Similar storyline: In 2012, 858,000 viewers tuned in to watch the episode of Girls in which Jessa plans to get an abortion . The actress adds that the stigma that still exists concerning abortion has made her more vocal about the subject, and she has never shied away from discussing her own experiences. 'I've always felt that reproductive issues should be something that women, especially, should be able to talk about freely,' she says. 'I have always been open about my stories.' Jemima is also concerned about the reproductive rights of her children — she has an 8-year-old step-daughter and a 4-year-old daughter with her husband, lawyer Michael Mosberg. 'I would love if when they're older, in their teens or their twenties, that the political issues surrounding their bodies were not there anymore,' she said. 'I would hate to see them having to fight for rights over their bodies.'","The actress, 29, says she had to pay out of pocket for her 2007 abortion because she couldn't tell her mother .

Tragedy: Pensioner Molly Wood died after being run over by her sister's car in a Tesco car park . Investigation: The 74-year-old died after the burgundy Kia Venga, pictured, had its engine running and 'lurched forward', trapping her under the wheels . Emergency services, including an air ambulance, were called but she died at the scene outside the Tesco store in Pontefract, West Yorkshire on March 25. Her sister was also hurt in the accident but escaped with minor injuries. West Yorkshire Coroner David Hinchliff said today: 'Both ladies got out and Mrs Wood was standing in front of the vehicle while her sister went for a ticket. 'Mrs Wood was talking to some friends who were also there and it appears the engine was still running. 'It's not clear whether Mrs Wood's sister sat in the vehicle or leaned in but it was at that point that the vehicle rolled forward hitting Mrs Wood causing her to be trapped under the vehicle.' He said a provisional post-mortem examination showed Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, died of multiple injuries. Scene: Mrs Wood, of Knottingley, West Yorkshire, was on a shopping trip with her younger sister, who was also injured . Detective Sergeant Ann Drury said: 'The incident took place around midday on Wednesday, March 25 when the car, a burgundy coloured Kia Venga, was unoccupied and lurched forward colliding with two women who were standing towards the front of the vehicle. 'As a result of injuries sustained in the collision, a 74-year-old woman from Knottingley died at the scene. 'The other woman, 70, was not seriously injured in the incident but has been left badly shaken by what took place. 'This was a very tragic incident and I would like to hear from anyone who witnessed the collision and is yet to speak to police.'

Ms Berry was put through to a call centre in South Africa when she phoned the company over the issue last month. She says she made small talk with the man who answered the query to fill 'dead air', but did nothing to suggest she was interested in him. The 21-year-old was stunned when she later received a string of messages from the man, who said his name is 'Miguel'. In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons .

There will be a capacity of 7,000 for July's match against France at London's Queen's Club, but well under 3,000 tickets may be available to the kind of supporters who created such an electric atmosphere in Glasgow for last month's first round. The rest will go to various organisations and governing bodies, with a considerable percentage going to well-heeled Queen's members as part of the deal to play the tie there. British tennis fans face a Wimbledon-type scramble for Davis Cup quarter-final tickets this summer . Andy Murray enjoys a spot of Champions League action alongside his friend Ross Hutchins at the Nou Camp . The Lawn Tennis Association acceded to the wishes of Andy Murray and GB Captain Leon Smith to play the tie on grass, which they feel best enhances their chances in what is a first Davis Cup quarter final staged at home in 29 years. That very much narrowed down the choice of venues for the tie that begins just five days after Wimbledon. The All England Club was never an option due to the stress the grass courts take during The Championships and ongoing development work there. A by-product is that tickets are likely to be as scarce as they are for the big fortnight. Sponsors plus organisations such as the LTA, Wimbledon, the International Tennis Federation and the French Federation have to be catered for. Queen's members will also have a considerable allocation as the tie means the stands there being up nearly all summer, with the AEGON Championships taking place in the middle of June as the main warm-up for SW19. Murray has an affinity for The Queen's club, having won the AEGON title there three times . Murray is currently practicing in Spain before beginning his clay court campaign later this year . The above will have until May 27 to take up or return their tickets, with only around 2,500 guaranteed to reach the ordinary public. A minimum 2,000 per day will then go on sale to those who are British Tennis Members – something that anyone can become by joining free – while at least 500 will go to supporters who have travelled abroad in recent years to support the British team. 'We have obligations to certain groups within the tennis family,' said an LTA spokesman. 'There are restrictions on numbers at the venue and we have to work within that.' Andy Murray, who has won the AEGON title three times, will lead the GB team in the match that takes place from July 17-19. France have seven singles players in the world's top 50, with their best grass court player Jo Wilfried Tsonga having just recovered from injury.

And the Southampton defender, who is being tracked by Manchester United and Chelsea, has fuelled talk that he could quit St Mary's this summer by insisting he wants to play Champions League football. Clyne's excellent displays for the Saints have thrust him into the forefront of Hodgson's plans. Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne poses with a WWE title belt while attending a pay-per-view event . Clyne joined Carlton Cole (left) to speak at at a Football Fighting Ebola event in London . He has started England's previous four matches - including the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovenia and Lithuania. Tottenham's Kyle Walker and Arsenal's Calum Chambers are also in contention for England's right-back berth - but Clyne has revealed Hodgson has told him the shirt is his as long as he keeps on performing. Speaking at the Football Fighting Ebola fundraising event in London, he said: 'Roy just said that ""You’ve done ever so well since coming in. It’s like you have been playing international football for a long time. The right back spot is yours at the moment, if you can continue on"". 'I’ve settled in well with the England squad. If I keep on putting in performances and keep on improving as a player, I can hopefully make the position my own and look to make tournaments and hopefully win tournaments with England as well.' Southampton have opened talks with Clyne, who was spotted at a WWE event in the capital on Monday night, over a new contract but face a huge fight to keep him beyond the end of the season. United are understood to be leading the race to land Clyne in the summer, but Chelsea have entered the race for his signature. The Southampton defender has been linked with a move to Chelsea and Manchester United . And the 24-year-old has openly admitted he is eager to start his Champions League career. 'I see myself hopefully playing in the Champions League and competing for titles and trophies. That’s what I’m aiming for,' he said. 'I’m definitely ambitious. Every player would love to be playing Champions League and winning trophies and titles. 'That’s what you play football for, that’s the dream. 'I would say Champions League is the next step in my progression. I think I need experience playing European football. 'We’re doing well with Southampton. Hopefully we can get there. That would be great.' Clyne attended the WWE's London edition of their show 'Raw' along with Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha on Monday night.

Szczesny was clearly touched by the efforts of his girlfriend and took to Instagram on Monday to thank her. 'Best birthday ever!' he wrote. Arsenal's triumph over Reading sees them reach the FA Cup final for the second consecutive season, having also won the competition last year against Hull City. This year, it will be Tim Sherwood's Aston Villa who stand between the Gunners and more glory, after they defeated Liverpool in the other semi-final on Sunday. Szczesny joined Arsenal's academy in 2006 from hometown club Legia Warsaw and graduated to the first-team in three years later. Although he has racked up nearly 200 appearances for the north London outfit since then, this season has raised question marks over Szczesny's long-term future. He was caught smoking in the wake of Arsenal's 2-0 Premier League loss at Southampton on New Year's Day and has only made Cup appearances since then.

After going back inside his house to find he son missing, he made the horrifying realization that he backed over Jackson with his truck. Jackson was hit by the front wheels of the vehicle backing up and when the front wheels back around, he essentially walked right into the side of the vehicle. 'When I got out of the truck, I hopped out of the truck to run to the back door and hopped up on the stoop and the back door was wide open,' Brian said. Bayer said he wishes he could have done something to prevent his son's cruel fate and describes himself as the kind of father who would check the floor to make sure there was no change or small objects his son could accidentally swallow. 'I went flying out the back door basically to see him on the driveway, and um…he had already been hit at that point in time and I had backed over him,' he added.

dce1580f3a2630564b7cbad90216ed75a00318cf,"Kent Sprouse was put to death by lethal injection Thursday night in Texas. Sprouse acknowledged almost immediately after he was arrested more than a decade ago that he killed a police officer and another man outside a Dallas-area convenience store. A jury decided in 2004 that he should be put to death, and unsuccessful appeals since then have focused on whether Sprouse was mentally ill at the time of the slayings in 2002 and should be spared the death penalty. He died 22 minutes after being injected and is now the fifth inmate to be executed this year in Texas, the nation's most active death penalty state. Death row: Kent Sprouse gunned down Ferris Police Officer Marty Steinfeldt, 28, at a gas station outside of Dallas before also shooting dead a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, in 2002 . In his final statement shortly before he was killed, Sprouse said; 'I would like to apologize to the Moreno family and the Steinfeldt family for all of the trouble I have caused them. 'I would like to apologize to my family for all of the trouble that I have caused them. I would also like to thank my family for all of their support. I guess that’s it.' Sprouse was convicted of the death of Ferris Police Officer Harry Marvin 'Marty' Steinfeldt III, who was shot outside the Ferris Food Mart about 20 miles south of Dallas. Steinfeldt, 28, was responding to a 911 call about a customer shot outside the store. Witnesses said Sprouse carried a shotgun into the store the afternoon of Oct. 6, 2002, while he made a purchase and then walked outside and fired toward two men at a pay phone. He went to his car and appeared to have some trouble with it, then shot and killed a customer, Pedro Moreno, 38, who was pumping gas nearby. As Steinfeldt drove up, he was met with gunfire and hit twice under the arm where his vest did not protect him. He managed to fire 17 shots and wound Sprouse in the chest, leg and hand. Court records indicate that Sprouse told an officer who accompanied him to a hospital that he believed Moreno was an undercover officer, so he shot him. 'And I shot the other officer that was in uniform,' Sprouse said, according to the records. Medical tests showed Sprouse, a Boone County, Missouri, native, had taken illegal drugs within the previous 48 hours. 'He started hitting the meth and went crazy,' Jim Jenkins, his lead trial lawyer in 2004, recalled last week. 'Even his family was afraid of him.' Kent Sprouse, 42, was sent to death row for a 2002 shootout at a Ferris, Texas, convenience store that killed police Officer Harry Steinfeldt III (right) and customer  Pedro Moreno, whom Sprouse had asked for help repairing his car . Jurors rejected an insanity defense and pleas for a life prison term. Sprouse was charged but not tried for Moreno's death. 'It was a senseless taking of two human lives,' Don Maxfield, the now retired Ellis County chief felony prosecutor who handled Sprouse's trial, said last week. 'It's just a sad story all the way around.' The U.S. Supreme Court in November refused to review Sprouse's case. Ferris Police Chief Sam Love said he and several of his officers plan to be outside the Huntsville Unit prison Thursday evening to show support for their deceased colleague. Steinfeldt had been with the Ferris department about two years after serving as a police officer in the Army. 'I don't think it's too soon or too long or whatever,' Love said of Sprouse's scheduled lethal injection. 'My feeling is the criminal justice system has done its work and we can move on now.' Scene: Sprouse is expected to be executed about 6 pm Thursday in Huntsville, more than 150 miles southeast of Dallas, by lethal injection. The process is expected to take 15 to 30 minutes at most . Texas Department of Criminal Justice officials said that a recent purchase of pentobarbital meant they had enough of the sedative to carry out Sprouse's execution and three others set for this month. The state's supply will need to be replenished for at least three other executions that are scheduled in May and June. Death penalty states have found it increasingly difficult to acquire drugs as manufacturers, bowing to pressure from death penalty opponents, refuse to sell to state prison agencies for use in capital punishment.","Kent Sprouse, 42, died of a lethal injection Thursday in Texas .

It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

35b061a74f06747135e4447859c4ccd95ba4cb2b,"Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act – which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a former member of the US Congress, where he was a reliable conservative vote on social issues – but he said Wednesday that he won't sign a new religious freedom bill into law . LIKE FATHER, LIKE – WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I’m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience – but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move – sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it – means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably – or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version – and Arkansas' – expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration.","'My son Seth, signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Republican Gov.

54f645a1e8fe742206af8cd184e3400655229d31,"Vladimir Putin is planning to exploit the threat of nuclear war to force Nato out of countries bordering Russia, it has been claimed. A secret meeting between intelligence figures in Moscow and Washington reportedly revealed Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region. Notes from the meeting are also said to have revealed that Putin is planning imminent 'destabilising actions' in pro-Western Baltic states in a direct challenge to Nato's promise to defend the countries from Soviet-style Russian expansionism. These disturbances are thought to likely involve cyber attacks or ramping up local ethnic tensions in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania intended to unsettle the region. Threat: Vladimir Putin will consider any attempt to return the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine as declaration of war and will take any necessary step - including using nuclear weapons - to retain control of the region . Notes from the top secret meeting between American and Russian officials in Germany last month have reportedly been seen by The Times. They suggest Russia is prepared to respond with force to the build up of Nato defence forces in the Baltic and by carrying out a wave of cyber attacks that can not be traced back to Moscow. The Kremlin officials - who were briefed by Russian Foreign Minister Segei Lavrov before the meeting and spoke of behalf of Putin - are said to have issued 'a spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military' in response to the growing Nato army in the region. As well as the situation in the Baltics, two other potential flashpoints were reportedly identified that could lead to nuclear war between Russia and the West: the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine, and any future attempt to return the annexed Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. Firepower: Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukrainian military (pictured) - who hope to defeat pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country - as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border . In Crimea, Russia is understood to have said that any attempt remove the region from Russian control would be met 'forcefully including through the use of nuclear force'. Meanwhile, Moscow described Nato's supply of weapons to Ukraine in the hope of defeating pro-Russian rebels in the east of the country as a 'further encroachment' on the Russian border. 'The Russian people would demand a forceful response [to such advances]', the Kremlin intelligence chiefs reportedly added. It is the threat posed by Russia to the Baltic states that is thought to be imminent, however, after Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania all raised concerns that Moscow has ambitions in the former Soviet territories, prompting Nato to establish a 'rapid reaction force' in the region. The threat of a Russian invasion of the countries is currently considered so great that Lithuania has gone as far as to reintroduce conscription in order to ensure it is prepared for all out conflict. Ready for conflict: Soldiers take part on in action training near the eastern city of Mariupol in Ukraine . News of the growing tensions emerged as a new men's clothing label launched in Russia in the hope of cashing in on the wave of patriotism currently sweeping the country. The move comes ahead of a giant military parade planned in Red Square on May 9 to mark the 70th anniversary of end of the Second World War underscoring the decisive contribution of the Red Army to defeating Hitler and the Nazis. Unveiled at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Moscow, the brand is called The Army of Russia. The design bureau of the Russian Defence Ministry, headed by Leonid Alexeev, showcased balaclavas, shiny 'military boots', sweat pants and tops emblazoned with the slogans 'Army', 'Polite', and 'Politeness conquests the cities'. 'Polite' is a phrase used by Russians to justify their takeover of Crimea last year. It refers to pro-Moscow forces' apparently 'polite' requests for the dramatically outnumbered Ukrainian security personal to leave the region.","Russian intelligence chiefs took part in secret meeting with U.S. officials .

But Alexandre Fernandez, rowing coach of Botafogo club based in Rio, said he had no worries about the phenomenon and  believes the cause was natural, not because of pollution.

The dead fish are being scooped out of the water by rubbish collectors using nets and are then taken to Rio de Janeiro's main dump . Rio's environmental secretariat has insisted that the latest incident is the result of a sudden change in water temperature.

However, several scientists have rejected that explanation, saying that pollution is really to blame. Estefan Monteiro da Fonseca, an oceanographer at Fluminense Federal University, said the official explanation 'makes no sense'. Despite more than 37 tons of the fish being removed from the water, there is still an overwhelming stench which has prompted complaints . Picturesque? Rio de Janeiro's stunning landscape has been blighted by the dead fish, which are currently being cleared from the water .

Alexandre Fernandez (not pictured), rowing coach of Botafogo club, said he's not worried and believes the cause of the deaths was natural . He said: 'The lake continues receiving large quantities of sewage.' He added that it has large concentrations of sulfur because of the organic material dumped into it, and depending on the wind, that material rises to the surface and kills fish.

c4c46eb3bcb0a1b5fecb21e6ea8ccf23f46655c2,"A widow who was left £15million by a high-rolling gambler has launched a multi-million pound lawsuit against his family – claiming she is owed up to £385million more. Ruanne Dellal says her husband Jack was worth at least £400million when he died and the £15million left to her was an ‘absurd presentation’ of his true wealth. The former beauty queen has launched a High Court claim against his relatives, in which she claims the property tycoon must have given away vast chunks of his fortune in secret deals to his family. Scroll down for video . Lawsuit: Jack Dellal left his whole estate to wife Ruanne, but she is suing after discovering that it amounts to just £1.7million . Daughters: Mrs Dellal is suing six of her husband's children, including Gabrielle, left, and Jasmine, right . Mrs Dellal, 61, whose own assets have been valued at £41.5million, says she is owed a ‘reasonable provision’ following the death of the legendary gambler. Her late husband, known as ‘Black Jack’, was a regular at the gaming tables of casinos in Mayfair and Monaco and gambled £1.7million in a single night in 2006. His family dispute his widow’s allegations and the true extent of the tycoon’s wealth will now be scrutinised by the High Court, which will assess Mrs Dellal’s claim that she has been short-changed. She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a £1million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received £15.4million and he also put £20million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian émigré parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top £1billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for £58million - more than £700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for £55million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for £130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a £150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around £56million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple’s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain’s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth £400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a £50million ‘secret stash’ hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a ‘strong’ case that her husband had access to ‘very considerable resources’, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: ‘It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.’ Mr Dellal’s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal’s wealth meant there was ‘no prospect’ of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an £8.5million mansion in Regent’s Park, central London, a £3million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple’s £5million home in Hampshire, a £1.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost £6million and has investments in the Middle East worth £26.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been ‘somewhat diminished’ recently, although Mr Dellal’s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss Mrs Dellal’s case without further scrutiny of her late husband’s finances. No date has yet been set for the case to be heard.","Jack Dellal left his entire estate to wife Ruanne but it was worth just £15.4m .

f6cfb25e507e879fee5de1c5955f43e90bf43523,"A father and son were shot dead in an execution-style murder moments after party guests left their home in a quiet neighborhood. Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, an oil company manager, had been celebrating a victorious football game in their garage in New Orleans, Louisiana, on Wednesday. But moments after jovially waving goodbye to the last-remaining revelers shortly before midnight, they were both shot dead at close range in an attack that shocked and baffled the quiet community of Metairie. They were found by David's wife, Nicholas's mother, who had been in a bedroom when she heard gun shots. Scroll down for video . Shocking: Nicholas Pence, 25, (left) and his father David, 56, (right) were shot dead 'execution-style' at home on Wednesday night after a football party in their garage, or 'man cave'. Police believe it was a botched burglary . Tragic: They were found lifeless by Elizabeth Pence (center), mother to Nicholas (second left) and wife to David (right) moments after the shooting, which has left the quiet neighborhood of Metairie in mourning and shock . Charged: Police arrested Dexter Allen, 17, (left), and Haraqyon Degruy, 18, (right) in connection with the killings . On Sunday, police revealed 18-year-old Haraqyon Degruy and her friend Dexter Allen, 17, have been charged with the double killing. Neither have a 'significant' criminal history, officers revealed. The police investigation has failed to determine at link between the alleged assailants and their victims, or a motive. David Pence, a manager at a New Orleans branch of the international oil firm Baker Hughes Inc, was shot three times in the chest while sat in an armchair. Nicholas was shot in the face and back. He was found lying on the floor of their so-called 'man cave'. Elizabeth Pence dialed 911 to report the shooting, and the theft of her purse, iPod and iPhone. Friends of Nicholas, known to friends as Nick or 'Peezy', have set up a fundraising page to supplement funeral costs and support his surviving mother and sister. The family lived on Clifford Drive, a leafy part of Metairie, which is one of New Orleans' wealthier areas . Initial reports suggest it could have been a botched armed burglary, as Allen and Degruy were linked to earlier car break-ins. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Jefferson Parish Sheriff Newell Normand said: 'Once again, this particular happenstance was completely, totally, shock-the-conscience type of homicide — obviously execution-style, very close.' Members of the community have expressed their horror, describing Nicholas and David as outgoing and lively neighbors. 'They were very good people. They got along with everybody.' close family friend Paul Meyer told WWL TV. 'I can't comprehend how someone could do this to a family like that.' Another friend said he was in the garage with Nicholas just minutes before the murder. Police believe 17-year-old Allen fired the fatal shots before running to the car and saying 'I just shot two people' to Degruy, who allegedly drove off, the New Orleans Advocate reported. Degruy has been charged with two counts of being an accessory  to first-degree murder and one count of vehicle burglary. Allen is being held on charges of fleeing police and two counts of first-degree murder. Weapon: Col John Fortunato of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office holds the heavy-duty gun which authorities believe was used to kill David, an oil company manager, and his son Nicholas after their party this week . A police report says the younger Pence had pointed out a suspicious white Toyota crawling through the street . Neighbor and friend Michael Soignet has described the agonizing moment Mrs Pence returned to the address, saying: 'She just gave me a strapping hug, and I choked up. She choked up. There were just no words.' Describing the victims to The New Orleans Advocate, she said: 'You'll never find anybody that's going to throw out a bad word on them, and if somebody does, they don't have their story right. 'This had to be a random act. It had to be.'","Nicholas Pence, 25, and his father David, 56, had friends round to celebrate a victorious football game on Wednesday in their rural New Orleans home .

1ca36d545c702dec959bd0a59ae1870da8536793,"This eighteen-month-old boy pulled a rice-cooker brimming with boiling water down on his head, burning deep scars into his face and leaving him almost blind. As a crack team of surgeons from the Australian charity, Interplast, worked last March to save the sight of little baby Seng, from Vientiane, Laos, inspirational burns survivor Turia Pitt watched on. Turia was deeply moved by the plight of the baby with big, brown eyes. That's because she knows that if she lived in a country like Seng's, she wouldn't be here. Foreign doctors wouldn't have been able to save her from the flames that nearly killed her by lashing 64 per cent of her body with burns in 2011. 'I wouldn't have survived,' she said during a candid interview ahead of hosting a fundraising gala on Thursday which aims to raise funds for more volunteer medicos to head overseas to save lives and livelihoods. 'If I was from Laos or Bangladesh, no ifs or buts, 100 per cent I would have died.' Scroll down for video . Stronger than ever and inspired by a little burned baby: Turia Pitt (pictured), who experienced burns to 64 per cent of her body during a September 2011 ultramarathon through the Kimberley, Western Australia . Burned by boiling water: Little baby Seng (left) is pictured being operated upon by surgeons in Laos (right) in a desperate attempt to save his sight. Turia Pitt witnessed the operation . Seng's sight was saved by keen doctor volunteers from Interplast. Turia told Daily Mail Australia Seng was 'for sure' one of her inspirations in working for Interplast . Fitter and stronger than ever: Turia Pitt's recovery from the horrific burns that left her clinging to life is inspirational. She recently ran a half-marathon and beat the time she ran before the 2011 Kimberley blaze . Turia, who has been operated on more than 200 times since she was caught in the flames, believes Australians take their medical system for granted. Her remarkable recovery is a case-in-point. Few would have thought she would be more athletic now than she was before she was seared with burns while running the Kimberley ultra-marathon three-and-a-half-years ago. 'I'm fitter now than I was before!' Turia told Daily Mail Australia. Nervous about medical complications, Turia was 'dumbfounded' when she ran a half-marathon last month at a quicker pace (1hr 45mins) than her time before she was burned (1hr 50mins). The only difference was that she needed to douse herself in water every 5km, as her skin has lost the ability to keep her temperature stable. Powered by a fierce determination to prove herself, Turia Pitt is fitter than ever, embarking on a ferocious fitness program in a bid to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. The six-day-a-week program features three major planks, working on the burns victim's already impressive cardio fitness, strength and flexibility. If it sounds daunting, never fear - even Turia admits she struggles with staying motivated sometimes. 'All of us make excuses, don't we? I think it's a normal thing to do... I think it's part of being human.' THE PROGRAM . CARDIO : 2 x 2.5k swims per week and she runs around 30kms a week . STRENGTH: 2 personal training sessions per week, involving conditioning exercises including box-jumps and squats . FLEXIBILITY: 2 yoga sessions each week, 'just to get a good stretch' 'Maybe I've got something to prove... I think I am more motivated' Asked about what motivates her to keep so fit, she told Daily Mail Australia there are bigger obstacles in life than running a marathon. 'Maybe I've got something to prove.... I think I am more motivated,' she said, revealing her intense, six-day-a-week training regimen. She is hoping to compete in the 2016 Melbourne Ironman. 'Compared to what I've been through, things like doing a marathon are rather minor by comparison.' There were many dark moments during her recovery, she said - ones that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but that of others. Turia experienced many dark moments during her recovery that required her to draw upon not only her own strength, but others as well . Her partner Michael Hoskin (left, pictured during a hike recently) has been Turia's most steadfast supporter throughout the entire ordeal . On Thursday, Turia will hold a gala to raise funds for the same charity that saved Seng's sight, Interplast. She will also provide an update on how Seng is progressing . 'There were terrible moments when I just wanted to give up,' she said. Not self-conscious: Turia Pitt has always taken pride in her appearance . Only recently she had a scare on the operating table when she stopped breathing while surgeons were attempting to install her new nose, terrifying her partner, Michael Hoskin, and mother Celestine Vaite, who been by her side throughout the entire journey. 'I guess I was really blessed because I was surrounded by a really good support team, my partner (Michael), my family, my friends, the doctors, the nurses, even my local community of Ulladulla. 'In those really hard times I did draw strength from the people around me'. Given the nature of her work with Interplast, appearance was another topic Turia dwelled upon while talking to Daily Mail Australia. She said she has always taken pride in her appearance, which hasn't changed. The burns don't concern her - instead, they are something she is accustomed to. 'Let's say you're at a party and you're self conscious and you think your arse looks big,' Turia said. 'Every time someone looks at you, you going to think, ""they're thinking my arse looks big"". 'But if you aren't really thinking that at all, you won't see it. 'I'm not looking for people who are looking at me. 'But then, if I was really self-conscious, I'd probably notice it a lot more - because I'm sure there are people who do look at me.' Years after the disaster, life is something close to normal now for Turia, who lives life according to a simple creed. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' she said. 'And that's kind of what I've always done.' As for baby Seng, it is understood his big, brown eyes can see again - perhaps allowing him to live a life with the same clarity of purpose as Turia. 'All I do is wake up and try and get the most out of each day,' Turia Pitt told Daily Mail Australia. That is the simple creed by which she lives her life .","Baby Seng, from Laos, is the little boy who touched Turia Pitt's heart .

Roberto Mancini has Liverpool midfielder Leiva and Barcelona's Song, currently on loan at West Ham, on his list of alternatives if Jovetic and Toure prove too costly. Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told Sky Italia: 'Dreams are beautiful, I'm trying to prepare something and I hope my dreams come true. Lucas Leiva (left) is believed to be a target for Inter Milan and could leave Liverpool in the summer . Alex Song has impressed during his loan spell at West Ham United and would be available for a transfer . 'Jovetic? In the past there was something, especially last summer. We had gone quite a bit forward in the negotiations, we were hoping to conclude the deal but then Negredo became injured and Manchester City changed their minds. 'He is a great player, he fits the profile of the player we are looking for. He is not very young but he is fully mature and still has a lot to give. He is a very talented player but the English club buys very often but seldom sells.' Jovetic looks likely to leave the Etihad this summer after being omitted from the club's Champions League squad earlier this season to make room for January signing Wilfried Bony. The Premier League champions rejected several bids from Inter last summer, while Juventus showed interest in the Montenegro star during the last transfer window. Roberto Mancini remains keen on the Manchester City duo he worked with while he was at the club . Yaya Toure (left) and Stevan Jovetic both look set to leave the club in the summer and Inter are keen . Toure, meanwhile, has been heavily linked with a move this summer and Mancini made his admiration known for the Ivorian earlier this month. Mancini said: 'Yaya has played in every top League, apart from Germany and Italy. 'If, as it seems, he wants to have an experience in Italy, then there is this possibility he could come here.

Jim Murphy began Labour's Scottish manifesto launch in Glasgow by saying: 'My thoughts and the thoughts of everyone in the room go out to Karen's family. None of us can in anyway imagine the pain and horror that they are going through. 'Glasgow and Scotland stands with you.' Former colleagues and friends in her hometown in County Cork, Ireland today remembered the 'beautiful, smiling' 24-year-old who was dedicated to helping the injured and sick. Her father, John, said yesterday that he, Miss Buckley's mother Marian and her brothers Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Friends and family have paid tribute to Karen Buckley - pictured with her brothers (l-r) Brendan, Damien and Kieran - after a four-day police search found her body yesterday . Her body was found at High Craigton farm after a huge search was launched to find her earlier this week . Miss Buckley's former supervisor at the Hibernian Hotel in the town of Mallow told the Irish Independent: 'She was always smiling, no matter how hard the work. She could never do enough to help you.' Karen’s former  school principal, Susan O’Keefe, said: ‘She was a beautiful girl and she was a great pupil. 'It’s sad. We are here on a fine summer’s day but Karen is not. We’re all just the worse off for such a lovely person been taken from us, and for everyone in this community, it is a shocking tragedy.’ Karen was a ‘great all-rounder’, participating in ladies’ football with Clyda Rovers and athletics with her school in Analeetha, Ms O’Keefe added. ‘At that time we were a much smaller school then we are now, so we were just like a big family. It is a big blow.' Yvonne Bane, the principal at Miss Buckley's former school in Mallow added: 'The community in St Mary's Secondary School is united in grief at the sad news concerning Karen Buckley, a former student of our school who completed her Leaving Certificate here in 2009.

'The school community have been sharing warm memories of our beautiful, former student over the last number of days.' And a spokeswoman for the University of Limerick, where Karen studied nursing, said: 'Karen was a very valued member of the UL Community as well as the wider nursing and medical communities in Limerick, having spent time working in both the University Hospital Limerick and the University Maternity Hospital. 'The thoughts of the entire UL community are with her parents and family and her wide circle of friends as well as her UL classmates and medical colleagues.' A 21-year-old man was arrested in connection with Ms Buckley's death yesterday. He made a brief appearance in a private hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court today. Friends of Ms Buckley raised the alarm on Sunday morning when she failed to return from a night out at The Sanctuary in the west end of Glasgow. The search led police to Dawsholm Park, where Ms Buckley's handbag was found on Tuesday, and a property in the city's Dorchester Avenue, before the farm where the discovery was made. Ms Buckley moved to Scotland in February and was a first-year occupational therapy student at Glasgow Caledonian University. Miss Buckley's parents, Marian and John, came from Ireland to help the search for their 'cherished' daughter . Miss Buckley grew up in the town of Mallow, County Cork, whose residents expressed shock at her death . Her family, who travelled to Scotland on Tuesday, have said they are 'absolutely heartbroken'. Her father John Buckley, 62, said she was an outgoing girl who 'thoroughly enjoyed life'. He released a statement through Police Scotland which read: 'Marian and I, together with our sons Brendan, Kieran, and Damian are absolutely heartbroken. Karen was our only daughter, cherished by her family and loved by her friends. 'She was an outgoing girl who travelled the world, where she met lots of people and thoroughly enjoyed her life. We will miss her terribly.' More than £50,000 has been raised to support the Buckley family in an online drive organised by her former classmates at Limerick University. The 24-hour appeal closed last night after reaching £50,001 - ten times the initial target of £5,000. The Go Fund Me page was set up to cover the family's travel and expenses while in Scotland and to support the upkeep of their farm in Cork.

But it seems that some are setting their kids on the chosen path earlier than expected. Especially these mothers and fathers, who have projected their geeky interests onto their slumbering newborns in a series of adorable photographs. Art and photography community, BoredPanda have created a thread encouraging parents to showcase their 'true nerdy colours' by dressing their babies up as sci-fi characters, like Princess Leia from Star Wars . Another baby is dressed up as widely-recognisable Nintendo character Mario, complete with tiny dungarees, the red flat cap and even a fake felt moustache . One sleeping newborn is sporting a completely knitted Wonder Woman costume . Art, design and photography community BoredPanda has created a thread encouraging parents to upload cute images of their babies showcasing their parents' 'true nerdy colors.' And of course, obliging parents have taken to the thread with professional photography shots of their trussed up newborns. Dressed as characters ranging across fantasy and sci-fi movies, books, TV shows and comic books, the adorable babies are seen in different scenarios and positions that have clearly been carefully arranged by their parents. A few of the images have even been subject to careful doctoring via Photoshop, in order to make the scenarios more realistic. Spiderman's a popular choice! Another baby is pictured alongside toy replicas of his superhero comrades . These babies are dressed as Star Wars Jedi knights, complete with light sabers and the characteristic brown cloak . One baby has been incorporated into a complicated Harry Potter scenario, complete with round-framed glasses, suitcases for Hogwarts and a magic wand .

41c6edecee127c396d17e2e9115a4a89252cc52b,"(CNN)The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday said it is ordering Pacific Gas & Electric Co. to pay a record $1.6 billion penalty for unsafe operation of its gas transmission system, including the pipeline rupture that killed eight people in San Bruno in September 2010. Most of the penalty amounts to forced spending on improving pipeline safety. Of the $1.6 billion, $850 million will go to ""gas transmission pipeline safety infrastructure improvements,"" the commission said. Another $50 million will go toward ""other remedies to enhance pipeline safety,"" according to the commission. ""PG&E failed to uphold the public's trust,"" commission President Michael Picker said. ""The CPUC failed to keep vigilant. Lives were lost. Numerous people were injured. Homes were destroyed. We must do everything we can to ensure that nothing like this happens again."" The company's chief executive officer said in a written statement that PG&E is working to become the safest energy company in the United States. ""Since the 2010 explosion of our natural gas transmission pipeline in San Bruno, we have worked hard to do the right thing for the victims, their families and the community of San Bruno,"" Tony Earley said. ""We are deeply sorry for this tragic event, and we have dedicated ourselves to re-earning the trust of our customers and the communities we serve. The lessons of this tragic event will not be forgotten."" On September 9, 2010, a section of PG&E pipeline exploded in San Bruno, killing eight people and injuring more than 50 others. The blast destroyed 37 homes. PG&E said it has paid more than $500 million in claims to the victims and victims' families in San Bruno, which is just south of San Francisco. The company also said it has already replaced more than 800 miles of pipe, installed new gas leak technology and implemented nine of 12 recommendations from the National Transportation Safety Board. According to its website, PG&E has 5.4 million electric customers and 4.3 million natural gas customers. The Los Angeles Times reported the previous record penalty was a $146 million penalty against Southern California Edison Company in 2008 for falsifying customer and worker safety data.

20e6d0d3071c6588894885da2c015064095c66af,"A US citizen has been killed in a mortar attack in Yemen after he traveled to the country in an attempt to extricate his pregnant wife and daughter from the civil war there and fly them  to California, family say. Jamal al-Labani was an Oakland gas station owner, his cousin Mohammed Alazzani told KPIX-TV. According to Alazzani, al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's two-and-a-half-year-old daughter. Alazzani told KPIX al-Labani was trying to get his family out of the war-torn Middle Eastern nation and take them to Oakland - but he couldn't because the US has withdrawn its diplomatic staff and the country has shut down most airports. Rebels from the Houthi Islamist group have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. They have advanced to the city center despite 11 days of air strikes by a Saudi-led coalition of mainly Gulf air forces. Scroll down for video . Family: Jamal al-Labani was in Yemen visiting his pregnant wife and the couple's 2 1/2-year-old daughter . Attack: Jamal al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died . Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia launched the air strikes on March 26 in an attempt to turn back the Iran-allied Shi'ite Houthis, who already control Yemen's capital Sanaa, and restore some of Hadi's crumbling authority. The air and sea campaign has targeted Houthi convoys, missiles and weapons stores and cut off any possible outside reinforcements - although the Houthis deny Saudi accusations that they are armed by Tehran. Career: al-Labani reportedly wished to take his family to Oakland, though there was no way to do so given what has been happening in Yemen . The fighting has failed so far to inflict any decisive defeat on the Houthis, or the supporters of former president Ali Abdullah Saleh who are fighting alongside them, but the growing death toll and humanitarian suffering has alarmed aid groups. Speaking to CNN, al-Labani's family said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving a mosque Tuesday and soon died. Council for Islamic Relations spokeswoman Zahra Billoo told CNN: 'All of these other governments, Russia, China, Ethiopia, India ... they have all been evacuating their citizens. 'So to say that it's impossible for the U.S. to evacuate their citizens is difficult to grasp.' In a statement issued to the television station, the State Department said 'We encourage all U.S. citizens to shelter in a secure location until they are able to depart safely. 'U.S. citizens wishing to depart [Yemen] should do so via commercial transportation options when they are available. 'Additionally, some foreign governments may arrange transportation for their nationals and may be willing to offer assistance to others.' At the time of the attack al-Labani was with his teenage nephew, who was also killed, Al Jazeera America reported. Alazzani told the news outlet that ahead of the attack '[al-Labani] was trying to find a way out because he felt his family was in danger.' He also told Al Jazeera America Houthi forces launched the mortal shelling on Tuesday. al-Labani's sons from an earlier marriage reside in California, according to Al Jazeera America. They are reportedly 13 and 16 years old. In a message posted Friday on its website, the State Department said 'On February 11, 2015, due to the deteriorating security situation in Sanaa, the Department of State suspended embassy operations and U.S. Embassy Sanaa American staff were relocated out of the country.' 'The level of instability and ongoing threats in Yemen remain severe,' the message said. 'There are no plans for a U.S. government-coordinated evacuation of U.S. citizens at this time.' The agency also warned 'Keep vital records and travel documents close at hand; U.S. citizens should be prepared to depart at a moment’s notice. The airports are currently closed, but may open unexpectedly; other unforeseen opportunities to depart may also suddenly arise.' Houthi fighters and allied army units clashed with local militias in Aden on Sunday, and eyewitnesses said gun battles and heavy shelling ripped through a downtown district near the city's port. The United Nations said on Thursday that more than 500 people had been killed in two weeks of fighting in Yemen, while the International Committee of the Red Cross has appealed for an immediate 24-hour pause in fighting to allow aid into Yemen. The ICRC, which has blamed the Saudi-led coalition for delays in aid shipments, said it received approval to fly in medical supplies and staff and hoped to send two planes on Monday. A spokesman for the military coalition said the ICRC had approval to fly in aid on Sunday but pulled out because of problems with the company from which it chartered a plane. Brigadier General Ahmed Asseri also said a Sudanese flight was prevented from landing at Sanaa on Sunday by authorities in the Houthi-run capital, and a Turkish evacuation flight was held up. 'Usually, the delay is because of the other side,' he said. A pro-Hadi militia source said 36 Houthi and allied fighters were killed on Sunday in Aden's central Mualla district, near the port, while 11 of Hadi's combatants died. Houthi forces initially advanced towards the port area, but hours later had been pushed back several streets towards an army base. 'There are bodies in the streets and we can't get close because there are Houthi snipers on the rooftops. Anything that gets near they shoot at, and the shelling on Mualla has been indiscriminate,' a medic told Reuters. Asseri said the coalition was providing pro-Hadi fighters with intelligence, equipment and logistics. 'We hope in a few days they will control most of the city,' he told reporters in Riyadh. Valentina Abdul Kareem, an Aden council member, called on both sides to implement a ceasefire so that civilians could be evacuated. 'Aden is going through a humanitarian and health crisis,' Abdul Kareem said. Residents and merchants said stores had largely run out of produce, milk and other foods due a lack of access to the rocky peninsula city, whose main routes to agricultural hinterlands lie through the battle zones. Victim: al-Labani's family has said he was struck by mortar shrapnel after leaving an Aden mosque Tuesday and soon died. His 14-year-old nephew was also reportedly killed . Business: al-Labani owned this Oakland, California, gas station . Armed: Followers of the Houthi movement raise their rifles as they shout slogans against the Saudi-led air strikes in Sanaa, Yemen on Sunday. Houthi forces have been battling to take Aden, a last foothold of fighters loyal to Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi . At least two main city districts have been without power for days after a rocket knocked out a main power station on Friday, and other areas suffered repeated cuts. Water has also been cut from some central districts. Asseri said that was a deliberate policy by the Houthis to create a 'chaotic situation' in Aden. Both Saudi Arabia and the Houthis say they are ready for talks which could return Yemen to the political transition which started when Saleh stood down in 2012 following huge street protests against his rule, inspired by wider Arab uprisings. But they have set out incompatible conditions for the talks and neighboring Oman, which often steers an independent course in the Gulf and has stayed clear of the Saudi-led military operations, said last week that neither side was ready for negotiations. A senior Houthi member said on Sunday the group is ready for peace talks as long as the Saudi-led air campaign is halted and negotiations are overseen by 'non-aggressive' parties. The fighting is only one of many conflicts in the Arabian Peninsula's poorest nation, which also faces tribal unrest, a simmering separatist movement in the south, and a threat from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the east. U.S. military personnel carrying out a covert drone war against AQAP were withdrawn last month after the Houthis advanced south towards Aden, close to the base out of which they operated. In the eastern coastal town of Mukalla, tribesmen deployed on the streets, pushing al Qaeda fighters out of much of the town just three days after the militants overran it, residents said. The tribal fighters entered Mukalla on Saturday, pledging to restore security after the militants broke into its jail on Thursday, freed a local al Qaeda leader, ransacked banks and took over local government buildings. France said its navy evacuated 63 people including French nationals from Aden on Sunday. Turkey said it evacuated 230 people, including non-Turkish citizens, by plane from Sanaa.","Jamal al-Labani was a Oakland, California, gas station owner, as well as a husband and a father-of-three .

6d9493fe42df31e6e18b3345652a0d748820589f,"Ian Murray reckons a supposedly easier run-in can swing second place Hibs' way ahead of Rangers in the last month of the Championship season. His Dumbarton side have faced both of his former teams in the league this term and will do so once again  in the final weeks of the campaign. But while Stuart McCall's men have the momentum at present - beating Hibs and Cowdenbeath while Alan Stubbs' men also lost to Raith - Murray wouldn't be surprised to see the balance of power swing back towards Easter Road before long. Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes that Rangers will struggle to maintain their pace through the run-in . Rangers - currently level on points but having played a game less - still have two matches to play against title winners Hearts, including Sunday's match at Ibrox, while the Leith side take on their city rivals just once more. HIBS: April 4 Queen of the South (h); April 8 Dumbarton (a); April 12 Hearts (h); April 22 Livingston (a); April 25 Alloa (h); May 2 Falkirk (a) RANGERS: April 5 Hearts (h); April 9 Queen of the South (a); April 12 Raith (h); April 15 Livingston (a); April 18 Dumbarton (a); April 25 Falkirk (h); May 2 Hearts (a) 'Rangers got a good result against Cowdenbeath last Saturday to keep themselves in contention and I think it's going to be close but I still believe Hibs have the easier run-in,' said Murray. 'They do have tough games as well including one against Hearts and if they're serious about finishing second, they need to beat the likes of ourselves and Queen of the South at Easter Road this Saturday. 'The derby will take care of itself. I think it's going to be really tight and I can't see either side going through the rest of the season undefeated. Both will drop points. 'But the fact Rangers play Hearts twice and one of those games is on the final day of the season doesn't help them. With Hearts getting the trophy at Tynecastle after that match, it doesn't do them any favours as that's a game Rangers might need to win. 'Hibs were favourites to finish second for a while after they beat Rangers 4-0 at Easter Road then 2-0 at Ibrox and because of the lack of form Rangers were showing. Both wins were comfortable and suggested Hibs had overtaken Rangers. Although they've been pegged back since, I still think Hibs are slightly ahead.' Rangers' attacking midfielder Haris Vuckic, on loan from Newcastle, scores against Cowdenbeath at Irbox . The team finishing second face a potential four games to get back into the top flight, while the third team have a potential six. Murray's Dumbarton team are virtually assured of a place in next year's second tier thanks to a 14-point lead over second-bottom Cowdenbeath and could become mathematically safe this weekend after they play Jimmy Nicholl's strugglers on Saturday. But the 34-year-old is adamant his side will still have plenty to play for as they look to have a say in who goes up and down. Murray added: 'We'll play Cowdenbeath and Alloa which is obviously huge for them at the bottom of the table. 'We still have to go to Queens and we've got Rangers and Hibs at home so we've got games that are meaningful for others. 'There's no pressure on us at all now so we can go out and play with a bit more freedom and be a bit more relaxed than normal. 'But it won't be a case of us not turning up. We want to get as big a gap as we can between ourselves and the relegation places.'","Dumbarton boss Ian Murray believes Rangers' tough run-in could mean they miss out on second place in the Scottish Championship to Hibernian .

c34d84d38ccfd021ba0b3712dc23feadd455af5b,"(The Hollywood Reporter)Richard Dysart, the Emmy-winning actor who portrayed the cranky senior partner Leland McKenzie in the slick, long-running NBC drama ""L.A. Law,"" has died. He was 86. Dysart, who also played Coach in the original 1972 Broadway production of Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning ""That Championship Season,"" died Sunday at home in Santa Monica after a long illness, his wife, artist Kathryn Jacobi, told The Hollywood Reporter. The acclaimed ""L.A. Law"" — created by Steven Bochco (who eventually handed off the series to David E. Kelley) and Terry Louise Fisher — aired for eight seasons from 1986 to 1994. For playing the founder of the firm McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak, Dysart was nominated for the Emmy for outstanding supporting actor in a drama series for four straight years, finally winning the trophy in 1992. ""I always had him in mind for that role,"" Bochco said in a 2002 interview with the Archive of American Television. ""He's so avuncular. So I reached out to him. You know, Dick is sort of an old hippie. So he went into his closet and tried to find a lawyer outfit, and he came to meet us wearing a suit and tie. He was perfect."" ""We got together, mapped out the character's past to give us a basis from which to work, and it's all gone smoothly since then,"" Dysart said in a 1990 interview with The Seattle Times. ""Sometimes I worry — it's all been going too well — a role I love to play in a series that's about as good as you can get. Something's wrong!"" Perhaps Dysart's most memorable character arc on the show was when he was found in bed with power-hungry competitor Rosalind Shays (played by Diana Muldaur). He was one of the few actors to appear in every episode. Dysart's range of authority -figure parts ran right to the top. He limned Harry Truman in the CBS telefilm ""Day One"" and in the ABC miniseries ""War and Remembrance,"" both of which aired in 1989, and he was Henry L. Stimson, the 33rd U.S. president's Secretary of War, in the 1995 HBO telefilm ""Truman,"" starring Gary Sinise. Similarly, he played the Secretary of Defense in ""Meteor"" (1979). Hollywood Reporter: Most powerful people in N.Y. media . Dysart also performed extensively in the medical- (movie) field, performing enough doctor roles to, perhaps, qualify to practice. His two most memorable came in classic satires: in Paddy Chayevsky's scathing ""The Hospital"" (1971), starring George C. Scott (a good friend), and in ""Being There"" (1979), as Melvyn Douglas' doctor. He also was a doctor who died a gruesome death in John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" (1982) and a physician in such films as ""The Terminal Man"" (1974), ""The Falcon and the Snowman"" (1985) and ""Warning Sign"" (1985). Dysart portrayed J. Edgar Hoover in the 1993 USA telefilm ""Marilyn & Bobby: Her Final Affair"" and in Mario Van Peebles' ""Panther"" (1995). Dysart also excelled as cranky coots and shifty sorts. He portrayed a motel receptionist in Richard Lester's ""Petulia"" (1968); was the bad guy who battled Clint Eastwood in ""Pale Rider"" (1985); stood out as a power player in Oliver Stone's ""Wall Street"" (1987); and sold barbwire in ""Back to the Future III"" (1990). Dysart was born March 30, 1929, in Boston and raised in Maine. Following high school, he attended the Gould Academy in Bethel, Maine, for a year, served in the U.S. Air Force and attended Emerson College, where he graduated with a master's degree in speech communications. At the time, he was interested in a career in radio (he became fascinated with the medium in first grade, when he was bedridden for a year because of rheumatic fever) but was soon tempted by acting. He moved to New York on a whim and was able to land minor roles on TV and a part in an off-Broadway production of ""The Iceman Cometh"" opposite Jason Robards. In the mid-1960s, he joined the American Conservatory Theater and toured the country doing plays, then landed roles on Broadway in ""All in Good Time,"" ""The Little Foxes"" and ""A Place Without Doors."" He received a Drama Desk Award for his performance in ""That Championship Season."" Hollywood Reporter: Q&A with Liz Smith . Dysart's credits include an eclectic array of movies, including ""The Crazy World of Julius Vrooder"" (1974), ""The Day of the Locust"" (1975), ""The Hindenburg"" (1975), ""An Enemy of the People"" (1978), ""Prophecy"" (1979), ""Mask"" (1985) and ""Hard Rain"" (1998). On television, he was top-notch in the telefilms ""The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman"" (1974), ""The People vs. Jean Harris"" (1981), as Dwight D. Eisenhower in ""The Last Days of Patton"" (1986) and as studio chief Louis B. Mayer in ""Malice in Wonderland"" (1985). Survivors also include his stepson Arie and daughter-in-law Jeannine Jacobi, mother-in-law Lenore, brother and sister-in-law Nadine and John Jacobi and grandchildren Abby and Levi. A private memorial is being planned. In lieu of flowers, the family requests donations be made to the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, an outdoor theater in Topanga Canyon in the Los Angeles area. Dysart and Jacobi had a second home in the forests of British Columbia. He was lured out of retirement for his last onscreen appearance, the ""L.A. Law"" reunion telefilm of 2002. ""They remain timely, with cases about points of law that are still current,"" he said of watching ""L.A. Law"" reruns in a 2002 interview with The Bangor Daily News.

2d4a9718592d8ab6a96ad11d6396196fa855767a,"A father whose 20-year-old daughter was found murdered in Iowa last year made a desperate plea from China for U.S. authorities to do more in tracking down her killer, six months after the girl's body was discovered. And police in Iowa seem to have now answered it, by issuing a warrant for the girl's boyfriend, according to reports. Tong Shao, a chemical engineering student at Iowa State University, went missing in September 2014. After a three week search, police found her body stuffed in the trunk of her Toyota Camry in Iowa City. Shao's boyfriend, Xiangnan Li, 23, was listed as a person of interest in the case and is believed to have been the last person to see her alive, however he bought a one-way ticket to China in the days after his girlfriend went missing and has disappeared, CNN reported. Wanted for murder: An arrest warrant has reportedly been issued for , Xiangnan Li, 23 (right), the boyfriend of Tong Shaom 20 (left), a University of Iowa student found murdered in September after going missing . Li had transferred to Iowa from Rochester Institute of Technology to be closer to Tong. The two had meet studying English in Beijing in 2011. They had checked into a hotel room together on September 5, 2014. The pair had stayed at the same hotel three times before and the owner knew them. According to police records obtained by CNN, two days earlier Tong had accidentally called Li - or 'pocket dialed' him - and he stayed on the line for 30 minutes, overhearing a conversation. Tong was complaining about Li to a friend and said things that 'were not nice', the records noted. The owner of the hotel told investigators Li left the hotel either on the night of September 6 or the morning of September 7, which he said was unusual, because he usually had to tell the couple to leave after the checkout time of 11am. Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8. He landed September 10. Before Li left Iowa, a text from his phone was sent to one of Tong's roommates. 'This message was purportedly from (Tong) and read that Li had an emergency in China and was flying back there, that she was going to take a bus to Minnesota to visit friends, and she would return in about a week,' the police documents stated. On September 9, Karen Yang, a friend of Li's sent him a message asking how things were going with Tong. 'Fine for now,' he replied. Killed: Tong Shao, 20, was found dead in her Toyota Camry on September 26 at an apartment complex in southeast Iowa City. Police believe she had been in the car for three weeks . Disappeared: Police say Li boarded a plane to China in Cedar Rapids, with a stopover in Chicago, on September 8, less than two days after his girlfriend was last seen alive . Tong's roommate, Jean, filed a missing person report on September 18, when she couldn't contact her. Together her roommates reached out to Tong's friends in Minnesota via social media, however they had not heard from her. On September 26 were body was found in her car parked near a low income housing complex on the outskirts of Iowa City. Residents had reported a foul smell, and responding officers wore Hazmat suits while inspecting the car, KCCI 8 reported at the time. Tong was found in the trunk, where her body had been for about three weeks, and next to her was a 15-pound barbell. An autopsy showed Tong died of  asphyxiation and blunt force trauma. A towel from the hotel had been wrapped around her head, according to police records. Inside the car police found copies of Li's flight information. Scene: Investigators had to don Hazmat suits to inspect Tong's car. Her body is believed to have been in the trunk for three weeks before they found it . Investigation: Tong died of blunt force trauma and asphyxiation. Her body was wrapped in a towel, and next to it was a 15-pound barbell, police say . Stench: Investigators grimace at the smell emanating from Tong's car after finding it dumped in September . A search of their hotel room found 'splatters and drips of various dried liquids throughout the room and behind the headboards of the beds,' the records said, concluding that 'it is possible her death may have occurred in the hotel room'. Tong's father, Chunsheng Shao, told CNN he was informed by detectives last month that an arrest warrant had been issued for Li. Li is wanted for the first-degree murder of Tong Shao. Police would not confirm this, saying their investigations are ongoing. While it is the first break in the case since the discovery of Tong's body, Mr Shao says he wants more to be done in solving his daughter's murder. Mr Shao and his wife saved $100,000 to send their daughter to university, and believed Iowa would be a quiet, safe place for her. 'We've given all our love to our daughter'"" Mr Shao said. 'I feel my life is meaningless after losing her.' Tragic: Tong, a junior chemical engineering student from China, was last seen in Ames more than three weeks before her body was discovered . While the U.S. has strong ties with China, there is no extradition treaty between the two. Legal experts say the most likely outcome is that China would prosecute people within China for crimes committed elsewhere. For Mr Shao, more needs to be done. 'We now plead with you, the U.S. authorities ...  share the evidence you have gathered with the Chinese authorities,' he said. 'This honorable act could very well save the life of other innocent and vulnerable victims, and will most assuredly allow the soul of our precious daughter to be comforted and rest in peace.'","Tong Shao, 20, was an international student from China attending Iowa State University .

His tiny face is coated in dust from the debris that crashed around him as the earth shook on Saturday, April 25, killing more than 5,000 people and injuring at least twice as many more. His name is Sonit Awal, and he's just four months old. On Saturday, Sonit was at home in Muldhoka, Bhaktapur, east of the capital Kathmandu, when the 7.8-magnitude quake sent tremors through Nepal and neighboring countries, according to Kathmandu Today. The house collapsed, burying the child, leaving his father Shyam Awal frantically searching for him amid the rubble. A desperate Awal called the Nepalese Army, and they too scrambled through the dirt and debris until midnight, before giving up hope and leaving. Sonit's father had lost all hope of finding his son alive, the paper reported, until he heard faint cries from below. On Sunday morning, the soldiers returned and at 10 a.m they lifted Sonit clear of the fallen rocks, beams, bricks and dust that had trapped him for 22 hours. His rescuers held him high in their hands to the sun, though his eyes were still wedged tightly shut. Sonit's face was exposed during the whole ordeal, though a hooded top and shawl protected his head and body during the cold night spent under rubble. The baby was taken to Bhaktapur Hospital and found to be uninjured; . His unlikely rescue provides some hope to a country that has experienced so much loss.","Baby Sonit Awal found in rubble of Nepal earthquake, Sunday morning .

A Florida man who was high on a designer drug called Flakka stripped and ran naked through traffic in Fort Lauderdale to escape from imaginary killers who he believed stole his clothes and wanted to murder him. Matthew Kenney, 34, told police he smoked Flakka before he streaked though traffic early on Saturday evening while only wearing a pair of sneakers. Flakka, which can be injected, snorted, smoked, swallowed or taken with other substances, has been nicknamed '$5 insanity' for its mind-bending effects and cheap cost. After he was arrested, Kenney told police he would 'rather die than be caught by these unknown people', the Sun Sentinel reported. He added that 'if I got hit by a car they would stop chasing me' according to a Fort Lauderdale Police reported. Kenney has previous arrests for disorderly conduct, making a riot and possession of a controlled substance. He was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation. Flakka is usually made from the chemical alpha-PVP, a synthetic version of the stimulant cathinone. That is the same type of chemical that is used to make bath salts. Scroll down for video .

7752c685358c5badf6dd5f3798386e9ff64dac3c,"A South Australian law professor has said that police acted ‘outrageously’ by subjecting a woman to an oral swab test after she was reported for flashing her breasts. Karen Davis, from Port Pirie in South Australia, notoriously flashed her K-cup breasts on Google Street View and was reported by police with disorderly behaviour. She handed herself into police voluntarily. However, ABC News reports that South Australian law professor Rick Sarre believed it should not result in charges or a court appearance and that the swab was unnecessary. Karen Davis (pictured) from Port Pirie has caused controversy after a picture appeared on Google Maps Street View showing her bearing her size-K breasts . ‘I think it's outrageous, but I know young juvenile offenders who have been questioned over certain things who have had the same thing happen to them,’ he said. 'That behaviour's being defended by the police commissioner, who says ''that's what happens these days''. ‘That doesn't surprise me because unfortunately that's the kind of law and order climate in which this Government has pushed us in the last dozen years.’ The 38-year-old was captured streaking by a camera car for the popular Google Maps app, which allows users to zoom in on certain streets and towns in cities all over the world with a 360-degree view. Police released a statement alleging the 38-year-old mother 'pursued' the Google car to make sure she was captured exposing herself, and that it was an illegal act. 'The woman’s actions were the same as someone flashing their genitals and the public expectation is that we take action,' said Superintendent Scott Denny of Port Pirie police. 'Recently in Port Pirie we arrested a man for exposing himself in public - this incident is no different. 'It is not appropriate for anyone to expose themselves in public places. Our community should be able to expect a bit of decency.' In the image, Ms Davis can be seen holding her arms up in the air with her T-shirt hunched up around her neck bearing her breasts, as she follows the Google camera cars around the street. Her sons are playing in the background and an unknown man stands at the fence watching. Across the road, a neighbour is lounging on her outdoor furniture, watching the whole thing unfold. Ms Davis, who plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday, has hit back at the controversy caused by her actions, claiming that 'flat-tittie chicks' are not confident enough with their own bodies and should focus on how they look. Ms Davis had issues with her size-K breasts in her 20's and is finally ready to embrace them and she plans to skydive topless for her 40th birthday . The mother says she is happy the picture appeared online and thought it was funny . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Davis was in tears over the nasty comments coming from her community after she was branded a 'bad mother' and 'pure filth' for her raunchy behaviour. 'They are narrow-minded people who are not happy with their own bodies,' she said. Posting on her Facebook account, Ms Davis addressed the fact that she pursued the car through Barry Street in Port Pirie until they got the perfect shot and believes locals are jealous of her antics. 'Haters hate, you got the guts to do it?' she posted on Facebook after the photo went public. 'All the flat-tittie chicks think I am disgusting. Big-boob envy has hit Port Pirie.' Taking to Facebook, disgusted commenters attacked Ms Davis' parenting skills after it became clear that her two sons were in the background of the picture. Ms Davis criticised 'flat-tittie chicks' and claimed they needed to focus on their own bodies . 'I'm sure your children will be proud of their mother that is probably going to cause them a lot of embarrassment,' one Facebook commenter said. 'Oh goodness. Can't even begin to imagine how her children are feeling,' another user said. However a select few came out in support of Ms Davis's show on Google Maps. 'Let her go, she's having some fun, Pirie people need to lighten up a bit. if more lovely ladies would get them out more often the world would be a much happier place,' one commenter said. Ms Davis told Daily Mail Australia that she thought the act would be funny and that it was an item she has now ticked off her bucket list. She also said that she has a friend in the United Kingdom and she thought it would brighten up his day if he saw the image online. 'I have a friend in the UK. If he looks on there he will smile,' she said. Ms Davis wasn't sure that the photo would make it on to Google Maps but she said she is delighted that it did. 'I think maybe some need to start their own bucket list and leave mine alone,' she said. While Ms Davis enjoyed herself bearing her breasts on the street, her neighbour sat on her lounger watching from next door . She also revealed that since the photo has been released she has attracted a whole host of new friend requests on Facebook. Many young men have tried to befriend her but she has not accepted any of them. Ms Davis said she has only learnt to embrace her size-K breasts in the last few years after spending her youth hiding them away. 'I  always got picked on and it wasn't until late in my 20's that I became confident in myself,' she said. She also revealed that she has to buy her bras online from the UK as they do not make size-K bras in Australia. 'It would be nice if they made my size bra in Australia,' she said. Ms Davis said that she would do it all again, even considering the backlash the image has received. 'It's my life not theirs,' she said. 'When you point your finger at me, you have 4 pointing back at yourself.' Some people online have suggested that she should be formally charged for her display but she has contacted the police who have confirmed that they have 'no concerns'.","Karen Davis was photographed on Google Street View flashing her breasts .

9f81c3049ff1b636ba416283ba4f5326fd578cc8,"She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match. The 29-year-old from Chicago has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen or other unusual places in the body. Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class. The brunette - who currently works for a non-profit addressing the legal rights of intersex individuals - immediately phoned her mother to discuss her suspicions and was shocked to find her worst fears confirmed. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: She might have the physical attributes of a woman but Jennifer Pagonis (above) was in fact born intersex, meaning she is genetically male and has the reproductive organs to match . Flashback: The 29-year-old (seen above circa 1990) has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), a very rare disorder which prevents a womb from growing and causes testes to grow in the abdomen . 'I was like, ""Oh. My. God! That's the thing the teacher was talking about ... ,""' Pagonis told the Associated Press. 'And then I went into like a freefall.' Two decades ago, there was little information about AIS and Pagonis' parents were'n't sure how to talk openly about the condition. Pagonis was born with an enlarged clitoris, no uterus and a partial vagina that surgeons later extended so that as an adult she might have normal sexual intercourse. However, Pagonis says she learned as a teenager that this was 'almost impossible'. Undescended testes were also removed from her abdomen to prevent them from developing cancer; although some doctors now think affected children can be monitored instead. For a long time Pagonis struggled with depression and angst until meeting young intersex adults who've embraced their differences. Growing pains: Pagonis said she always felt different with constant hospital visits but didn't learn the full truth about her condition until a college instructor described the hormone syndrome one day during class . Body confident: Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon,' doesn't identify as female or male and works as an artist and intersex activist against surgery . Pagonis now uses the first name 'Pidgeon', doesn't identify as female or male and works as an intersex activist against surgery. Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Pagonis' advice for parents with intersex infants? 'Take them home and love them ... just the way they are.' Alice Dreger, a Northwestern University ethicist and author, says it makes sense for parents to raise affected kids as boys or girls. 'But sometimes we get that gender assignment wrong. And in those cases it's particularly important that we've not done unnecessary interventions.' Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is when a person who is genetically male (who has one X and one Y chromosome) is resistant to male hormones (called androgens). As a result, the person has some or all of the physical traits of a woman, but the genetic makeup of a man. It is caused by genetic defects on the X chromosome. These defects make the body unable to respond to the hormones that produce a male appearance. Complete androgen insensitivity prevents the penis and other male body parts from developing. At birth, the child looks like a girl. The complete form of the syndrome occurs in as many as 1 in 20,000 live births. How many male traits people have differ in incomplete AIS. A person with complete AIS appears to be female but has no uterus, and has very little armpit and pubic hair. At puberty, female sex characteristics - such as breasts - develop. However, the person does not menstruate and become fertile. Persons with incomplete AIS may have both male and female physical characteristics. Many have partial closing of the outer vaginal lips, an enlarged clitoris, and a short vagina. Complete AIS is rarely discovered during childhood. Sometimes, a growth is felt in the abdomen or groin that turns out to be a testicle when it is explored with surgery. Most people with this condition are not diagnosed until they do not get a menstrual period or they have trouble getting pregnant. Incomplete AIS is often discovered during childhood because the person may have both male and female physical traits. Tests used to diagnose this condition may include blood work, genetic testing or a pelvic ultrasound. When it comes to treatment, testicles that are in the wrong place may be removed when a child finishes growing. Estrogen replacement can also be prescribed after puberty. SOURCE: MedLinePlus . Vocal: Using social media to voice her thoughts, she recently tweeted: 'Diagnosed [with] testicular feminization (AIS) & labeled male pseudo-hermaphrodite exist in the gray. But, I believe, so does everybody.' Idea exchange: It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions . Pagonis hopes that by speaking out about her condition she can help comfort others with AIS. Efforts in the medical sphere also are underway to change the way intersex children are treated. 'The way that we took care of things in the past... where there was a fair amount of secrecy, where there was surgery done in the infant state, and potentially irreversible surgery, is probably not the best way to go about things,' said Dr. Earl Cheng, who runs the two-year-old sex development disorders program at Chicago's Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital. The program is one of several nationwide that employ a team of specialists including surgeons, hormone experts, genetic counselors, psychologists and ethicists. The team helps families weigh their options, including whether surgery should be considered at all. It's estimated that at least 1 in 5,000 U.S. babies are born each year with intersex conditions. Some affected children have typical male or female chromosomes, but genetic glitches and hormonal problems that begin in the womb, cause genitals to resemble those of the opposite sex. Others have a male-female blend of sex chromosomes and reproductive organs.","Jennifer Pagonis has Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS)

Their first target: the Johannesburg suburb of Jeppestown, where xenophobic violence broke out on Friday. South African police raided a Jeppestown hostel Tuesday while troops secured the perimeter. Earlier, Defense Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula announced the plan to deploy an undisclosed number of troops to areas where police are spread too thin while trying to curb deadly attacks against immigrants. ""This intervention is not an indictment on the police. ... We are coming in because they need that support,"" she said after visiting Johannesburg's Alexandra township, one area where mobs have attacked immigrants from other African nations and looted their shops -- ostensibly based on the belief that immigrants are taking South Africans' jobs. Seven people have been killed in recent violence against poorer immigrants, many from South Africa's neighbors. Xenophobic killing caught by photographer . Much of this month's violence happened in the port city of Durban, where at least two foreigners and three South Africans were killed after mobs with machetes attacked immigrant shops. Thousands of people took temporary shelter at refugee centers or police stations as a result, according to aid group Gift of the Givers. Similar violence happened late last week in Johannesburg, where immigrant-owned shops were looted or destroyed. The attacks came as residents accused immigrants of taking their jobs and committing crimes. The unemployment rate in South Africa is 25%, according to government figures. The United Nations said the attacks began in March after a labor dispute between citizens and foreign workers. What's behind the xenophobic attacks in South Africa? CNN's Brent Swails reported from Johannesburg. CNN's Jason Hanna reported and wrote from Atlanta.","South African troops help police conduct raids in Jeppestown .

Dyche, 43, has a growing reputation having overseen a remarkable transformation of fortunes since arriving at Turf Moor in October 2012. The former Chesterfield defender made a nonsense of the relegation favourites' tag to lead the Clarets to an unlikely promotion from the Championship to the top flight last season. Burnley veteran defender Michael Duff is preparing to take on Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday . Duff has backed his manager Sean Dyche to one day take charge of the England team . The 37-year-old has played in eight different divisions before finding himself taking on the likes of United . This term they are attempting to defy the odds again and with eight games remaining they have a fighting chance of survival in the Barclays Premier League. Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age. The Pro Licence is nearly all based on management, so you look at sessions differently, look at the manager's presentations - and this one isn't a bad manager to learn from.' Dyche has improved Burnley's fortunes since he took over at Turf Moor in October 2012 .

d6a9784d1ffee56969b3e54ebd39fe3621470c4f,"A former lager lout who ballooned to 24 stone has lost nearly half his body weight by giving up his favourite drink. Rugby prop Dale Forrest, 26, of Bolton, would sink up to 12 pints a night, but decided to shed the pounds after seeing a photo of himself while out with his fitness fanatic friends. In December 2013, the bank teller decided to ditch the booze, give up his favourite fatty readymeals and greasy takeaways and hit the gym. Dale Forrest would drink up to 12 pints a night - and ballooned to 24 stone - before giving up beer to lose weight . Dale, pictured at his slimmest, was worried he would look like a 'beached whale' next to his friends on holiday . Since then, Mr Forrest, who had a holiday planned with his mates and didn’t want to look like a ‘beached whale’ next to them, has lost 10.5 stone. He said: ‘I can now go on nights out and feel confident - even without the Dutch courage. ‘I no longer feel like people are laughing at me and all it took was a bit of willpower.’ Mr Forrest struggled with his weight from a young age and in adulthood fell into unhealthy habits. Before shedding the pounds Mr Forrest ate a cheese and sausage bap for breakfast, a Big Daddy Box Meal from KFC for lunch and a meat feast pizza for dinner. Dale, pictured sitting down, said he would consume beer, alcopops and shots regularly on nights out . Dale, pictured before his weight loss (right) and after losing 10 stone, gave up greasy takeaways for healthy foods and started going to the gym regularly, and saw the pounds fall off . Despite being a rugby player, Dale weighed 24 stone due to his unhealthy lifestyle . He said: ‘I was inactive and ate and drank what I wanted. ‘All my friends were in really great shape. They got a lot of attention from girls and I got none, which was a bit depressing. ‘They were all quite careful about what they ate, but I thought nothing of having dinner at McDonald's regularly.’ Despite being a keen rugby player, Mr Forrest rarely exercised and lived on an unhealthy diet – and would regularly drink 12 pints of beer followed by shots and sugary alcopops on a night out with friends. He said: ‘I would drink in the pub with my friends every Friday and Saturday. ‘I would start off by having a few pints, then as I got a bit bloated I would switch to other drinks. By the end of the night I was downing Jaegerbombs and drinking alcopops.’ After a night out in December 2013, Mr Forrest logged on to Facebook to look at the pictures taken the night before. Dale is now taking part in a charity boxing match since losing weight . Dale, pictured before (left) during a rugby game, and (right) after losing more than 10 stone . He was horrified to see that he was nearly double the size of all his friends. He said: ‘I was shocked when I saw how big I was compared to my mates. ‘Me and the lads had just booked a holiday for the summer and I did not want to be the beached whale at the side of the pool. ‘I decided I had to change.’ Desperate to change, Mr Forrest set his alarm for 6am the next day so he could go to the gym. He said: ‘I had to drag myself out of bed - during the walk to the gym I felt like death and I struggled to find any motivation. ‘When I got to the gym things changed. I started with some weights and then did 15 minutes on the crosstrainer. ‘After I finished I felt I had achieved something, although it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. ‘I got a taste for it and started going all the time.’ Dale said he would start the night drinking beer and then move on to shots and alcopops . Dale (left before losing weight) turned his life around and lost more than 10 stone thanks to healthy eating . The committed slimmer also overhauled his diet, swapping fatty takeaways for lean meat and fresh vegetables. Before his dramatic weight loss Mr Forrest would snack on chocolate bars and gorge on a fat-rich diet. Now he eats porridge with blueberries for breakfast, grilled turkey with boiled potatoes and vegetables for lunch and grilled fish with green vegetables for dinner. Throughout the day he snacks on nuts, fruit, celery and protein shakes. He also started going to the gym twice a day, weightlifting before work and doing cardio in the evening. By February 2014 Mr Forrest had lost an impressive 3st 7lb. He said: ‘The biggest change was kicking the booze.

Meteorologists say early indicators show that an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit the region, with heavy rain possible from Thursday. The State Emergency Service was deluged with calls for assistance last week and has more than 4,000 jobs from the 24,196 requests still to be completed. SES spokeswoman Stephanie Wills says the organisation is concerned that more storms will these hamper clean-up efforts. Scroll down for video . Meteorologists say early indicators show an east coast low – the same weather system that lashed the state's east coast for three days last week – could hit again bringing heavy rain from Thursday through to Saturday .

Residents who have been hit by wild weather across New South Wales are being warned to brace for more floods and damage with another storm predicted to hit this week . People struggle against the heavy rain and strong wind on the streets in the Sydney CBD last week . 'Any weather that strikes up north is of concern to us, especially considering the devastation from the storm that hit last week,' Ms Wills told Daily Mail Australia. 'Any water is going to hit that saturated ground and raise flood levels again, and any wind is going to knock over the trees that are uprooted.' Ms Wills said the SES was particularly worried about the effect more wild weather would have on the Hunter region, which suffered through flooding and high winds in the last storm. 'That's our focus - the Hunter region - because they've been smashed,' she said. 'We really are quite concerned about that particular area. 'We are urging the community to prepare themselves, prepare their homes and prepare their families to prevent further loss and devastation.' Weatherzone meteorologist Kim Westcott said a trough of low pressure was forming along the coast, and would hit heaviest in the far northern parts of the state.

'It looks like we could get an east coast low later on this week, but it is certainly a different kettle of fish than we've seen last week,' Ms Westcott said. 'The difference is that it is a little bit further away from the coast and it is in a different area - so the heavy rain is probably not going to be over Sydney.' Ms Westcott said the weather system appeared to be moving quickly. 'We might get two days of rain but it's not likely to be the same three days of wind and rain we saw last week,' she said. Damage and destruction caused by flooding in Stroud in the NSW Hunter region . Bureau of Meteorology NSW regional director Barry Hanstrum said: 'Early indications suggest the main impacts of intense rainfall and strong winds will be on coastal areas in the states north east including the Northern Rivers and Mid North coasts, with heavy falls also likely for southeast Queensland. 'Current guidance suggests that rain will increase this week, and peak between Thursday and Saturday. 'Further rainfall is likely for catchments that have already experienced flooding during last week’s severe weather event.' The Bureau Of Meteorology said it was too early to tell how severe the weather system would be. Ms Wills said the SES would spend the next few days trying to complete as many jobs as possible, as well as warning people to prepare their homes should another severe storm hit. 'Obviously we're trying to get through has many as we can before next system hits,' she said.

The high-achieving high schoolers  have each been accepted to all eight Ivy League schools: Brown University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University and Yale University. And as well as the Ivy League colleges, each of them has also been accepted to other top schools. While they all grew up in different cities, the students are the offspring of immigrant parents who moved to America - from Bulgaria, Somalia or Nigeria. And all four - Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York - say they have their parents' hard work to thank. Now they hope to use the opportunities for good - whether its effecting positive social change, improving education across the world or becoming a neurosurgeon. The teens have one more thing in common: they don't know which school they're going to pick yet. The daughter of Somali immigrants who has already received a U.N. award and wants to improve education across the world . Star pupil: Munira Khalif, from St. Paul, Minnesota, says she has always been driven by the thought that her parents, who left Somalia during the civil war, fled to the U.S. so she would have better opportunities . Munira Khalif, who attends Mounds Park Academy in St. Paul, Minnesota, was shocked when she was accepted by eight Ivy Schools and three others - but her teachers were not. 'She is composed and she is just articulate all the time,' Randy Comfort, an upper school director at the private school, told KMSP. 'She's pretty remarkable.' The 18-year-old student, who was born and raised in Minnesota after her parents fled Somalia during the civil war, she said she was inspired to work hard because of the opportunities her family and the U.S. had given her. 'The thing is, when you come here as an immigrant, you're hoping to have opportunities not only for yourself, but for your kids,' she told the channel. 'And that's always been at the back of my mind.' As well as achieving top grades, Khalif has immersed herself in other activities both in and out of school - particularly those aimed at doing good. She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13. Incredible: Munira, pictured speaking at Malala Day at the UN, hopes to study political science at college . High achiever: She was one of nine youngsters in the world to receive the UN Special Envoy for Global Education's Youth Courage Award for her education activism, which she started when she was just 13 . She launched a non-profit group, Lighting the Way, to make education more accessible for East African youth, especially girls, through scholarships, libraries and improving sanitation issues. And she was also appointed as A World at School Global Youth Ambassador to promote universal education. Khalif, who plans to study political science at college, said she has yet to decide where to go and plans to visit a few more campuses before she makes her final decision. As well as the Ivy League schools, she also received offers from Stanford, Georgetown and the University of Minnesota - and she's still letting the realization sink in. 'I was very surprised,' she said. 'I am humbled to even have the opportunity to choose amongst these schools because they are all incredible places to learn and grow.' The Bulgarian housekeeper's son who couldn't speak English a decade before he was accepted to 18 top schools in the U.S. Driven: Stefan Stoykov cried on his first day of school because he could not speak a word of English but he is now a straight-A student committed to helping other pupils with language barriers . When eight-year-old Stefan Stoykov moved from his family's one-bedroom apartment in Bulgaria to the U.S. after his parents won a green card lottery, he could not speak a word of English. 'I started crying on the first day of class,' Stefan recalled of his first day in the second grade. 'I was scared. I was scared. I didn't understand what was going on around me.' But now 18 and a senior at North Central High School in Indianapolis, Indiana, he has been accepted into some of the finest schools in the world - and he admits he can hardly believe it. 'It is an incredible feeling,' Stefan told WTHR. 'I never knew that I would have a chance to choose from possibly the best schools from the world. 'I was hoping to get into at least one of the Ivy Leagues.' But as well as getting offers from all Ivy League schools, 10 other prestigious institutions also came knocking. He has yet to decide where he will go. He revealed that hard work and the support of his mother, a housekeeper, had helped him achieve his goals. Shortly after arriving in the U.S., his parents divorced and his father took a job as a truck driver, and he has not seen him much since. Impressive: Despite his early struggles at school, he said he knew that he had to make the most of the opportunities he had been given by his parents when they moved him from Bulgaria to the U.S. 'My parents had done so much to put me in this position, to put me in the United States of America,' he said. 'And I had to take advantage of that. I had to do something with the opportunities they gave me.' Stefan's extracurricular activities include tutoring other students with language barriers, running the cycling club and Spirit Week and joining the stock market club, the Indy Star reported. He is also valedictorian and secured a perfect SAT score by borrowing test guides from the library. He also helps his mother - who spent much of his childhood working so that she could support him - with her housekeeping duties so that it takes her half the time. The son of a Nigerian immigrant who dreams of becoming a neurosurgeon . Hard worker: Victor Agbafe, 17, says he believes his Nigerian immigrant mother set a good example for him in her job as a physician. He now hopes to study microbiology  with government or economics . Victor Agbafe, a student at Cape Fear Academy in Wilmington, North Carolina, has no idea where he will attend college, but he's certain on one thing: he wants to become a neurosurgeon. The 17-year-old was accepted to 14 schools in total, including all eight Ivy League schools and Stanford and Duke. Agbafe, who plans to double major in microbiology along with government or economics, called his acceptance achievement an 'amazing opportunity', WSOC reported. Just before he played a game for his school's basketball team, he learned that Harvard had made a decision about his application - but he waited until the game was over to find out. 'I owed it my teammates to be focused there,' he said. 'I didn't want to get too low on myself if I didn't get in. I also didn't want to get too high if I was accepted.' Going places: The teenager from Wilmington, North Carolina says he plans to visit as many campuses as he can before he makes his final decision by May 1. He hopes to become a neurosurgeon . He has also been part of North Carolina's Youth and Government program, where he was chosen as Speaker of the House. He says his mother, a Nigerian immigrant and physician, set a good example for him - but she refuses to take the credit. 'For God to crown his effort with success is just something that is just beyond me,' his mother Dorothy Agbafe-Mosley said. 'I am very happy that he has all these choices to make. But then it also makes it difficult because it's a lot of good schools. A lot of good schools.' Her son will make a decision later this month after visiting as many campuses as possible. The Nigerian student who credits his Target employee parents with his success . Top student: Harold Ekeh, from Long Island, New York, has been accepted to 14 colleges in total . Ten years after his family moved him from Nigeria to the U.S., Harold Ekeh is hoping to do something for them in return. The 18-year-old Long Islander was accepted by 14 colleges - including all Ivy League schools - and now hopes to study neuroscience to cure Alzheimer's, the disease his grandmother suffers from. The straight-A student at Elmont Memorial High School secured an SAT score of 2270. He also worked as editor-in-chief of his student newspaper and chief executive of the Model United Nations. But he wasn't expecting to get into so many top schools. As well as offers from the Ivy League colleges, he was also accepted by Johns Hopkins, NYU, MIT, Vanderbilt, and SUNY Stony Brook. 'It was crazy,' he told DailyMail.com. 'My mom was sat next to me and it was just letter after letter after letter. I couldn't believe it.' Afterwards 'I went to Chipotle with my friends for a half steak half chicken burrito bowl. It was perfect,' he said. Devoted: He hopes to study neuroscience and find a cure for Alzheimer's, which his grandmother suffers from . He said it was the resilience of his parents, former Target clerks Paul and Roseline Ekeh, that gave him the drive to achieve the best. 'It was such a huge thing for my parents to uproot our family, a family of six, from our home to a new country,' he said. 'I was worried as a kid about speaking with an American accent, but they had to worried about actually finding jobs. They joked that they came over for the 24-hour electricity. But I know it was so we would have opportunities as children. 'No matter how many times they got knocked down, they stayed positive, and kept telling me that the secret to success in unbridled resolve.' He said he is leaning towards going to Yale but will be visiting a few more campuses before making his decision before May 1.","Munira Khalif from Minnesota, Stefan Stoykov from Indiana, Victor Agbafe from North Carolina, and Harold Ekeh from New York got multiple offers .

73df16c85afd837cad83f559883f17d077ac51d4,"Comedian Dave Hughes has refused to apologise for calling radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television. Hughes and Hinch appeared on Monday night's Q&A panel discussing depression and alcohol, following the emergence of a video featuring Prime Minister Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a pub. Audience member Lauren Hayes asked Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb if he thought Mr Abbott's  'display of irresponsible drinking was an act of peer pressure or an attempt to become more popular with younger voters'. Scroll down for video . Australian comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) called radio broadcaster Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on national television . This sparked Hinch to question if binge drinking was as prevalent back when he was younger as it was today. But Hughes interjected and said this culture had existed and people drank to get drunk. To which the radio personality replied: 'I drank because I like the taste of wine.' Without missing a beat, the Australian comedian fired back: 'That's because you're a w**ker.' Hinch (above) and Hughes were on ABC's Q&A on Monday night discussing alcohol and depression . But Hinch would not have any of it, saying: 'It takes one to know one.' Hughes told Kiis 101.1 radio he would not recant his comment about Hinch. 'I absolutely stand by it. In that moment, and I think Derryn would agree... he was a w**ker,' the comedian said on Tuesday morning. And the veteran radio personality did not seem to mind the put down. 'I've been insulted by experts so I can handle it,' Derryn told the Melbourne radio station. 'I thought David Hughes was quite quiet last night. The episode came after a video surfaced of Tony Abbott skolling a beer in a Sydney pub on the weekend . Mr Abbott downed a schooner of beer in about six seconds while patrons cheered and encouraged him . 'Normally I look at him and he belongs to that breed of... comedians who think the louder you tell a joke the funnier it gets. I wasn't offended.' On social media, one Twitter user stood behind the radio broadcaster, saying: 'Boogly-eyed comedian Dave Hughes' high-horse 'w**ker' comment was way out of line; great response.' Another called Hughes out by using the comedian's same insult: 'Dave... is a w**ker.' But others were supportive of Hughes' view. '[Hughes] calling [Hinch] a w**ker... gold!' one supporter said. 'Hughesy is winning [Q&A] because you're a w**ker hinch,' another Twitter user said. Monday night's Q&A also saw a more serious Hughes tell the audience about his battles with alcohol and depression. 'When I was 21, I was drinking heavily and smoking marijuana and having sort of episodes at night, and I said to my mum that I think I've got schizophrenia,' the comedian said. 'We went to the doctor together - she was a beautiful mother - obviously, she helped me out. 'The doctor, we had a chat about it. I told him I smoked marijuana and he told me, made me stop doing that. And I did, stopped smoking marijuana and I stopped drinking. 'When I walked out of that doctor's surgery I felt so much better just at having told people about it.'","Comedian Dave Hughes called Derryn Hinch a 'w**ker' on Monday's Q&A .

b0c8b68ef3dfb64b19cc3787e54693f4dd12b5e3,"Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Ed Miliband - and 'risky if you are young, dodgy if you are older' in the words of Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. Both men were asked their opinion on the practice of sending sexy text messages in a quiz for fashion magazine Cosmopolitan's website. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that it is 'OK for other adults but not for me'. And Education Secretary Nicky Morgan answered: 'A bit too risky, thank you very much!' The verdict: Politicians should not sext, says Ed Miliband (right) and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (left) says it is 'risky' for youngsters and 'dodgy' if you are older . Their responses are hardly surprisingly considering the downfalls of fellow politicians when salacious messages are revealed in the press - including those sent by former MP Brooks Newmark and Tory official Iain Corby. The quiz, which was answered by hand, included a question on the worst thing about politics, which Mr Miliband said was Prime Minister's Questions - 'a bad advert for all of us'. Ms Bennett ticked 'not being able to make the changes you want to', while Ms Morgan opted for people thinking she is boring. Mr Clegg wrote: 'Sitting through 30 minutes of Cameron and Miliband yelling persistently at each other every Wednesday!' The four were also asked about what they would be if not politicians. Green Party leader Natalie Bennett responded that sexting is 'OK for other adults but not for me' Mr Clegg said a wildlife film-maker, while the Labour leader wrote: 'Trying to change the world somehow.' Ms Bennett said she would be an author and Ms Morgan a solicitor. Asked to describe their favourite hangover cure, Mr Miliband said: 'Drinking lots of water but it's been a long time since I had one...' Mr Clegg said: 'Three young boys running around usually does the trick.' Ms Morgan chose a bacon sandwich, while Ms Bennett responded: 'Home-baked gluten-free bread with butter and honey.' In another question, the politicians had to reveal the most hurtful thing they had read about themselves. The Labour leader offered: 'Where do I start?!' and Ms Bennett said a claim that she was trying to be cool, something she says she gave up at the age of 16. The Deputy Prime Minister replied: 'Not hurtful, just absurd - that I have a personal chef! Of course I don't.' Ms Morgan said it was generally people making assumptions about her motives when they have never met her. Another question asked what would be worse than joining the opposition. Mr Clegg said joining Ukip, while Ms Morgan said she would rather join the opposition than do a bungee jump. Ms Bennett and Mr Miliband responded 'none of the above' and 'no way' respectively. It's not difficult to see why the leaders believe politicians should steer clear of sexting as they have plenty of cautionary tales to learn from. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down in May's election after becoming embroiled in a humiliating sexting scandal last year. It was revealed the Conservative member  bombarded a single mother with up to 40 naked pictures and told her 'I am desperate for sex with you'. The father-of-five was forced to issue a grovelling apology after being caught texting explicit photographs of himself for a second time. He had already left his post as minister for civil society after he was exposed as having exchanged photographs with a male journalist posing as a glamorous young Tory PR woman. Tory MP Brooks Newmark is standing down this year after becoming embroiled in two sexting scandals . In April last year, details of salacious messages sent by top Tory official Iain Corby on a gay dating service were revealed. These referred to a sex party for Tory researchers at the party’s annual conference in Manchester, funded by Conservative MPs’ expenses. The Mail on Sunday revealed that the exchanges involved Mr Corby and were one of the reasons he suddenly quit as head of the Westminster-based Parliamentary Resources Unit (PRU), which is paid for by MPs via taxpayer-funded expenses. Disgraced Co-op boss Paul Flowers was suspended from his position after he was filmed buying hard drugs including crystal meth and crack cocaine. The Mail on Sunday revealed exchanges involving Tory official Iain Corby on gay dating service Grindr . The former Labour councillor was further shamed when a teenage rent boy revealed sexually explicit text messages exchanged between them - and revealed he had been asked to accompany Flowers to the summer party of Labour peer Baroness Thornton. And sexting has also caused problems for politicians across the pond. American politician Anthony Weiner, a former representative of the United States House of Representatives, is better known for his two sexting scandals. The first, in 2011, led to his resignation as a Congressman after he sent an intimate picture to a woman over Twitter. And then as he attempted to make a return to politics by running for mayor of New York in 2013, he was forced to admit to sexting three women after pictures were published.","Sexting is 'not advised for politicians', says Labour leader Ed Miliband .

eeaadebf0fc8512031f7b509b236024fd8e7060e,"Melbourne, Australia (CNN)A man stands on a beach in a distant land. Waves lap his ankles. He wades through the gentle dawn light, arms outstretched, his head held high. He is fully dressed; not a tourist but a freedom fighter. A photograph of this man, beamed around the world, becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty. It is 2015. The man is Peter Greste. If you thought the man might have been an Anzac on the shores of Gallipoli, such is the power of persuasion. It's easy to lead a horse to water when, in the centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign, our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance. The sum total of television programming, beer advertising, political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of Australia's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation: young (white) man plus distant beach equals sacrifice. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead. Last weekend I planted Gallipoli rosemary in my backyard; part of the proceeds go to the Avenues of Honour, a national project to preserve and restore Australia's living memorials. More objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game. To widen the scope of historical tribute, and also recall the words and deeds of the Australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment, is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive. But the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped Australia asunder. Even at the time, the Great War itself was divisive, a historical reality belied by today's bland, blanket coverage of ""the Anzac spirit"". Australia's participation in the war was contested from the outset. On August 11, 1914, veteran political campaigner Vida Goldstein wrote in her Woman Voter newspaper: ""It is a fearful reflection on 2,000 years of Christianity that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict."" As she had done 20 years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage, Goldstein rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words. ""The time has come for women to show that they, as givers of life, refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter."" Australian and New Zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate: the vote. ""The enfranchised women of Australia are political units in the British Empire,"" Goldstein argued, ""and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts."" Goldstein's early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace. Under the newly legislated War Precautions Act, the Woman Voter suffered censorship, leading Goldstein and her Women's Peace Army to fight on multiple fronts: ""We are fighting for Civil Liberty and against Military Despotism.""  Around the nation, trade unionists opposed to ""the capitalist war"" joined the movement. Australia had the only entirely voluntary military service among the Allied forces; less than 40% of eligible men signed up to fight ""for King and Country."" As the carnage at Gallipoli brought home the realities of war, recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread. General strikes halted industry, as workers reacted to the food shortages, unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of ""the Working Man's Paradise."" With enlistments falling away in 1916, Prime Minister Billy Hughes pushed for conscription and pushed through the Unlawful Associations Act. Groups that voiced opposition to the war, like the International Workers of the World, were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material ""likely to cause disaffection or alarm"". When waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike, the War Precautions Act was invoked to send them back to work. In September 1916, the Sydney Twelve were arrested and tried for treason. ""Fifteen years for 15 words"" was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment. The conscription referendums of October 28, 1916, and December 20, 1917, became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war — or the federal government's domestic policies. There were diverse reasons for that opposition, including the anti-British sentiments of Irish Catholic Australians. In Melbourne, the meeting place for such public debate was Yarra Bank, a pocket of land nestled between what today is Birrarung Marr and the Rod Laver Arena. Anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown Yarra River. Most protest meetings were peaceful, but one became infamously violent. ""Riotous scenes at Yarra Bank"", headlines around the nation proclaimed, when a demonstration organized by the Women's Peace Army in the week before the 1916 referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers. Both conscription referendums ultimately failed. The Australian Dictionary of Biography contains profiles of 174 anti-conscriptionists, many of whom went to jail, including Vida Goldstein's compatriots Adela Pankhurst and Jennie Baines. Baines was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at Yarra Bank in 1918. She is reputedly the first Australian prisoner to go on a hunger strike. Other protesters were deported. As historian Janet Butler reminds us: ""It does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide."" The enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of Gallipoli, manifested not only in the ""shattered Anzacs"" whose families bore the burden of care, but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped Australia's social and political relations in the 20th century. Lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today -- freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, freedom of speech — were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much, but are still accorded little recognition. Perhaps, by the 125th anniversary of the Gallipoli campaign, when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives, we will come to associate riverbanks, as well as beaches, with the potent ebb and flow of freedom.

Tom Richards, 25, was arrested yesterday morning in his home city of Swansea. After being held in a cell for 11 hours, the cage fighter was bailed at 7pm as police continue their investigation. It comes after Westbrook, 41, made claims on social media that her younger former lover had been violent towards her, posting a photograph on Twitter of her bruised hand. The pair were last seen together at an Essex pub last month (above) after splitting up in November . It comes after the 41-year-old accused her younger former boyfriend of violence online. She was seen last month with a black-eye. Richards strenuously denies the allegations and has not been charged . Richards, who is an MMA fighter, has vehemently denied the allegations against him. The pair split in November last year after spending months together in California while Westbrook tried to rid herself of drugs. Speaking of his arrest yesterday, a spokesman for Richards said there was 'no truth' behind the allegations. 'There is no truth in these allegations and we will be challenging them.' The couple split in November after spending months together in California . Police arrested Richards in Swansea yesterday morning on suspicion of physically attacking his former girlfriend in Essex. While denying ever harassing or harming his former girlfriend, a spokesman added being arrested had been 'upsetting' for Richards. 'He is training for a fight and could do without the distraction.

The film, 'Child 44', starring Tom Hardy, Vincent Cassel and Gary Oldman, tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in the Stalin era. It is based on a novel by British writer Tom Rob Smith and was due to premiere in Russia today. Scroll down for video . Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Child 44, starring Gary Oldman (left) and Tom Hardy . The Hollywood blockbuster tells the story of a serial killer who targets children in Stalin era Russia . Russia's culture ministry said the film distorted history as it celebrated its victory over Nazi Germany . Russia's culture ministry said the film's distributors in Russia, Central Partnership, had agreed to withdraw a request for a distribution licence after ministry officials viewed the film. 'Films such as 'Child 44' should not go out in our country on mass release, earning money from our cinema audiences, not in the year of the 70th anniversary of victory, not ever,' Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky wrote on the ministry's website. The move to effectively ban a major mainstream Hollywood film just a day before it was due to premiere is unprecedented. In recent years, Russia has cracked down harshly on negative depictions of the Soviet Union during the Stalin era, while criticism of those who fought in the Second World War is taboo. The culture ministry accused the film of 'distortion of historical facts and the idiosyncratic treatment of events before, during and after' the war. The film is set in 1952, a year before Stalin's death, and features a maverick investigator seeking a serial killer, while hindered by official attitudes that such murders are not possible in the Soviet Union. Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky (pictured) condemned the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime . 'You realise murder is strictly a capitalist disease,' French star Cassel hisses in a thick Russian accent in the film's English-language trailer. Culture minister Medinsky slammed the film for its depiction of the horrors of the Stalin regime and said it misrepresented a country that was 'one of the world leaders'. The film shows Soviet Army officers as 'blood-thirsty ghouls' randomly shooting people, 'especially gays,' Medinsky complained. Soviet women have to offer them sexual favours or 'be sent, as is customary, to the Gulag,' he added with heavy irony. The decision to pull the film came after the culture ministry on Tuesday gave it a distribution licence with an 18+ certificate. The head of Central Partnership, Pavel Stepanov, issued a statement saying he was 'satisfied' with the film's ban. 'We consider it's important in the future to increase state control over distribution of films that have a socially significant context,' he said. On Tuesday, Kultura state-funded arts newspaper, whose editor is a member of President Vladimir Putin's arts council, published a review of the film titled '44 shades of vileness.' 'Daniel Espinosa's film is made up of lies and spitting at Russia and Russians,' it wrote. Earlier this year the outspoken culture minister voiced his dislike of Russian art-house film 'Leviathan,' despite its landmark victory at the Golden Globes and Oscar nomination, complaining it was full of 'existentialist hopelessness.' Last month he sacked the head of a theatre in Siberia after its radical staging of a Wagner opera including images of Jesus Christ angered some Orthodox believers.","Russian authorities have cancelled the release of Hollywood's Child 44 .

aaba512f0e130084d17c2bed96296a960b473783,"Wealth: Training consultant Jay Rutland, 34, with his 30-year-old billionaire wife Tamara Ecclestone . The husband of billionaire heiress Tamara Ecclestone earned just £65 a week from his firm last year, it was revealed today. Jay Rutland, 34, who is married to the 30-year-old daughter of Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone, saw his company bring in just £3,378 over the 12 months to July 2014. The training consultant’s firm Brigante Business Developments, based in Battersea, south-west London, is listed in company records as providing ‘management consultancy activities’. Its latest accounts for the year to July 2014 were filed to Companies House a fortnight ago, showing the company - which was incorporated in July 2012 - having total net assets of £3,378, down from £18,131 the year before. The former stockbroker - who lives with his wife and daughter Sophia, one, in a £45million house in west London - married the heiress in a £7million wedding in France in July 2013. The couple, who met in January 2013 and were engaged a month later, celebrated Sophia’s first birthday last month with a farmyard-themed party that cost an estimated £70,000. This included ponies, a zebra, a balloon house and even a magical princess. And last year Sophia enjoyed a private visit from Father Christmas and a replica electric Bentley car toy. Miss Ecclestone’s family is worth an estimated £3billion - and the couple are said to own a £300,000 Ferrari, £123,000 Bentley GT Continental and a £100,000 Range Rover. Family life: The former stockbroker lives with his wife and one-year-old daughter Sophia (pictured) in London . Company: Brigante Business Developments is based in this building (above) in Battersea, south-west London . A spokesman told The Sun yesterday: ‘Although this company is still active it had not been trading in the financial year the filing reflects.’ Mr Rutland's high-earning career in the City of London ended in shame in 2012, when he was banned from trading over 'market abuse'. In a damning ruling, the Financial Services Authority concluded he was not a 'fit and proper person' and his behaviour demonstrated a lack of 'honesty and integrity'. In 2013 Mr Rutland needed treatment for facial cuts after he was ambushed by two men in a mugging when he stopped his black Ferrari - just a month after marrying Miss Ecclestone. He was robbed of a £50,000 Rolex and a £20,000 bracelet by at least two thugs in an attack caught on CCTV, but the high-profile prosecution of a suspect was dropped due to insufficient evidence. MailOnline has approached a representative of the Ecclestone family for comment on the accounts.","Jay Rutland, 34, is married to 30-year-old daughter of Bernie Ecclestone .

d28e5266dcf52af8640fb349af8deffc75372047,"Chelsea will try to add another trophy to their ever-expanding cabinet when the Under 19 team take on Shakhtar Donetsk in the final of the UEFA Youth League on Monday afternoon. Adi Viveash's team will start as favourites in Nyon, Switzerland after their resounding 4-0 win over Roma in the semi-finals on Friday, a result which continued their free-scoring form in this competition. Ahead of the final, we bring you everything you need to know. Chelsea striker Dominic Solanke starred in his side's emphatic 4-0 semi-final win over Roma on Friday . Solanke has scored 11 UEFA Youth League games during Chelsea's route to the final in Nyon, Switzerland . REMIND ME, WHAT IS THE UEFA YOUTH LEAGUE? In a nutshell, it's the Champions League - but for Under 19 teams. In its second season, the Youth League was created by UEFA to enable up-and-coming players in Europe's leading academies to gain valuable experience of playing in continental competition. The group phase runs in parallel with its big brother, with the same 32 teams as in the Champions League matched in the same groups. The main difference is that the knockout rounds are single-legged and the semi-finals and final in the same place over the course of one weekend. SO, WHERE IS THAT? Monday's final will be played at the Stade Colovray, which is situated in the shadow of UEFA's headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland. It's a pleasant spot, overlooking Lake Geneva, and is the home of Stade Nyonnais, who play in the Swiss third tier. It's capacity is 7,200 and pretty big crowds were there enjoying the sunshine and the football in Friday's semi-finals. WHEN IS THE GAME AND CAN I WATCH IT? It will kick-off at 3pm UK time and the match is live on British Eurosport. WHO WON THE COMPETITION LAST YEAR? The maiden winners of the Youth League were Barcelona, who defeated Benfica 3-0 in a one-sided final. The goals came from Rodrigo and a double from Munir El Haddadi, the competition's top goalscorer with 11 and now a member of the first-team squad. There was no English representation in the last four, though both Chelsea and Manchester City had made it to the quarter-finals. HOW HAVE THE BRITISH CLUBS DONE THIS YEAR? Chelsea, obviously, have made it all the way. Manchester City went out to Roma in the last eight, while both Arsenal and Liverpool tumbled out at the last 16 stage. Arsenal lost 1-0 to Atletico Madrid and Liverpool were beaten 2-1 by Benfica. ALL HOPES WITH CHELSEA THEN? Yes, and they will enter Monday's match as the marginal favourites. It is well-established that the Stamford Bridge academy is one of the best in England and last season saw the Under 21 team claim the Premier League title and the Under 18s win the FA Youth Cup. They will take on Manchester City in this season's Youth Cup final, too, over the next couple of weeks, their fifth final in six seasons. Having missed out on the NextGen Series title to Aston Villa two years ago, this is an excellent opportunity to assert their claim as one of Europe's best academies too. Chelsea's Isaiah Brown (left) tussle for the ball with Roma's Silvio Anocic (right) in the box . WHO HAVE THEY BEATEN TO GET THIS FAR? The Blues made a statement of intent in the group phase, winning five of their six matches and racking up 24 goals in the process. Slovenians Maribor were beaten 2-0 at home and 7-0 away, while Sporting Lisbon suffered 5-0 and 6-0 drubbings. Germans Schalke, who knocked Chelsea out last season, were beaten 4-1 before managing to win 2-0 at home. Chelsea then overcame Russians Zenit St Petersburg 3-1 in the last 16 courtesy of goals from Dominic Solanke, Kasey Palmer and Charlie Colkett. Atletico Madrid were then seen off 2-0 at Cobham in the quarters, with an own goal and another from Solanke securing their passage to Switzerland. But their most impressive performance came in the semi-final with Roma on Friday as a flurry of second-half goals from Colkett, Solanke (2) and Tammy Abraham left Roma in ruins. Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek (right) and Roma's Jose Machin (left) battle for the ball on Monday . WHAT ARE THEY SAYING? Coach Viveash was effusive about his team's qualities after their drubbing of Roma, telling Uefa.com: 'I'm very proud – proud of the players, proud of the staff who have worked very hard to get to this stage. When you see players perform like that it brings warmth to your heart. 'I feel very proud to work with that calibre of player and to watch them play is wonderful for everyone who works in our academy. They were excellent from minute one to minute 94 and thoroughly deserve their place in the final.' Tournament top scorer Solanke, who took his season's tally to 11 Youth League goals with a brace, added: 'I'm over the moon. We had quite a difficult journey yesterday because our flight was cancelled, so we had to get on with it today. It's amazing to reach the final. 'It's such a big tournament containing some of the best teams in the world. The level has gone up in the knockout games, but we've stepped things up as well and managed to reach the final.' WHO IS THE COACH? Adi Viveash is a former defender who played for Swindon Town, Walsall and Reading in the Football League during an 18-year playing career. He joined Chelsea's academy in 2008, starting with the Under 12 team and working his way up. In July 2011, he was appointed Under 18 coach and led the team to two FA Youth Cup triumphs in three seasons. Viveash stepped up to take charge of the under 21 team this season and doubles up to lead the under 19 side in the Youth League. MEET THE PLAYERS .

While being beautiful, fit and healthy is expected, it's all about a demand for the 'influencer' now. Thanks to the proliferation of social media, in order for modelling agencies to keep up with client demand, 'influencer' and 'blogger' divisions are now being added to their traditional model portfolio. General manager of Vivien's Models Catherine McGill told Daily Mail Australia that they launched an 'influencers' section two months ago because of the growing need to accommodate client demand for social media numbers. Scroll down for video . Influencer: Gigi Hadid is one of many in-demand models whose social media following is as much a draw card as her good looks for clients booking her on jobs . Self-made model: Mimi Elashiry turned her social media following into a modelling career . Big on Instagram: Elashiry has almost 700,000 followers . 'Our bookers  were giving me feedback that clients wanted models who might be blonde, beachy and had a high social media following,' she said. 'Now when we’re booking talent, in negotiation process, we talk about the girls numbers.' McGill says the average expectation of clients will range anywhere between 10,000 - 300,000 followers. 'It’s not hard and fast number, but 10,000 is the minimum number clients are asking for,' she said. 'So if models are getting up to that, they might get added to our 'Influencer' page.' Joseph Tenni of Chadwick Models told News.com.au that 'It’s not unusual for a client to ask “how many followers does she have?” before they ask what they look like.' Chic Management also started a 'blogger' management division two years ago. Of influencer: Prestigious model agency Vivien's has introduced an 'Influencer' page noting their models' social media stats . 'That line of just being a model is being blurred': Bloggers and influencers are now being snapped up by agencies capitalising on their following . General Manager Paul Thomas says it's now where all the money is being spent, with clients seeking hard and fast brand promotion. 'If you  think about it, your brand can send their product straight to someone's pocket rather than printing a catalogue in store and waiting for a customer go collect it.' Thomas told Daily Mail Australia it's all about the elusive 'cool girl' appeal. 'Influencers are like a captain of the ship - because there is so much information out there, people turn to models, fashion people and talent and begin liking what they are liking.' 'We do have clients that  book in a traditional sense, but new up-and-coming brands want a ‘cool girl’ with vast social numbers that they can book a campaign off the back of the model's social media,' he said. It's this combination of 'cool girl' meets followers and a 'lust-have' lifestyle that Thomas said is really drawing in clients, and models are now being trained how to self-promote on their Instagram to get work. International: American Alexis Ren has over 1.6million followers, and is in demand Down Under as much for her looks as her army of followers . 'Now that line of just being a model is being blurred, people want to know about the model but it's got to be organic, you can smell when it’s all a bit too staged,' he said. Thomas said health and fitness is very 'on brand' at the moment, so that's something the girls are encouraged to promote, which most of them naturally will as they stay in shape. 'With new faces we sit down with them and do social media training, to make sure those girls are representing us as well. We don’t need them to be serious posters, just once or twice a day, or one every day.' Chic manage American model Alexis Ren, who has over 1.6 million followers and has shot previous campaigns for Australian label General Pants. 'She has 1.6 million followers, a  huge following in Australia, her boyfriend is this amazingly good looking surfie and her Instagram is a mood board that makes you want to be on holidays with them.' Thomas said it's a coup for Australian brands because she is not only 5’8, beautiful and blonde  but  she is 'insta-famous', has an increase of 45,000 followers per week and has a boyfriend with almost a million followers, so they have the tools they need to sell her as a talent. Chic Management also says bloggers like Sarah Donaldson from Harper and Harley and Brooke Testoni have scored major campaigns with Oral B and Pandora  based on their social outreach and style.","Australian model agencies reveal new demand for social media following .

Elad Hershkowitz, a zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, placed a GoPro camera at the bottom of water troughs to capture the different perspectives. The animals – ranging from a rhino who almost kisses the surface of the water to a lemur who delicately licks it – were recorded for a total of 30 hours. Zookeeper Elad Hershkowitz, of the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv, filmed animals drinking on a GoPro camera . He placed the camera in the animals' water troughs and filmed them  for a total of 30 hours . The 26-year-old then cut the final footage down to four minutes. He said: ‘Capturing this footage was really special. It offers a completely unique perspective to anything I’ve ever seen before. ‘I had the idea whilst walking around the enclosures and I saw the zebras drinking. ‘It made me curious to see what was going on below so I decided to check how the rest of the animals drink. Hershkowitz said some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object in their troughs . A commanding rhino appears to almost kiss the surface of the water after it purses its lips and takes a drink . ‘There is a massive difference in how each animal drinks. Carnivores, like lions, drink a lot like domesticated cats and dogs. Herbivores like the rhinos and zebras suck up the water with their lips.’ According to Mr Hershkowitz, some of the animals were initially sceptical about the foreign object placed at the bottom of their trough. He said they attempted to check them out by putting their hooves and paws into the water first before going to take a drink. Eventually however, they got used to the camera’s presence and drank freely. A lemur is featured in the four minute footage and delicately licks the surface of the water with its tongue . A herd of zebra humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping the water from their trough . The zookeeper also anticipated a range of reactions from the animals before the experiment and ensured that the camera was secure before it took place. ‘I was really worried the lions would bite off the GoPro, so I placed a sheet of acrylic glass above the camera,’ he said. In the clip the lion can be seen aggressively breaking the surface of the water with its tongue, and is in complete contrast to a herd of zebra, who humorously bare their teeth while gently sipping.","A zookeeper at the Zoological Center in Tel Aviv recorded the footage .

Lund, 33, founded the Nikki Rich clothing line with Sambora and confessed last year that the pair had been having an on-off personal relationship for eight years. When their affair ended it plunged the business partnership into turmoil, just as the duo were preparing to open a boutique on swank Robertson Boulevard. Sambora's alleged threat came just days after Lund launched her first signature solo show at the opening of LA fashion week on March 18. 'They are in the midst of unraveling their fashion business Nikki Rich,' a source told Daily Mail Online. 'Things have become very bitter in recent weeks. 'The threat happened in the midst of Nikki launching her solo line. Richie apparently went mad on the phone at her and threatened to kill her. 'He said words to the effect that he was going to dig a hole in the desert and bury her.' Nikki, a close childhood friend of Kim Kardashian, filed a report Wednesday night with detectives from the Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. Back to back: The couple posed for the cover of the new edition of  LA Fashion Magazine before they went their separate ways . 'She held off going to cops hoping that the situation would resolve itself,' added the source. But after advice from lawyers and business associates she made the report. 'Richie has been drinking heavily for months and acting erratically . 'He has threatened violence in the past.' Nikki and Kim K are friends from way back . Lieutenant Jennifer Seetoo confirmed to Daily Mail Online that Sambora is a person of interest in the case. Under Californian law making criminal threats can be a felony offence punishable by up to four years in jail. 'A report was taken regarding criminal threats,' Lieutenant Seetoo said. 'It's an active investigation.' A representative of Mr. Sambora said there was no truth in Nikki Lund's claims. 'This is a cluster of fabricated lies in retaliation for Mr Sambora's decision to cease further funding of the unprofitable partnership, plain and simple,' said the rep. Sambora suddenly quit Bon Jovi during their 2013 world tour because of 'personal issues'. The New York Post later reported that Jon Bon Jovi had kicked out his longtime songwriting partner due to substance abuse issues. Sambora and Lund reportedly began their romance in 2006 - a year before his divorce from Dynasty actress Locklear was finalized. Denise Richards dated Sambora . Sambora is believed to be in Bora Bora with his ex-wife Heather Locklear and their daughter Ava . They are said to have carried on seeing each other despite Sambora going on to date another Hollywood beauty, Denise Richards. The long-time fling became public last December when Lund was doing publicity for the new fashion line. The curvy blonde confessed to Playboy TV: 'He's amazing in bed ... how could you stay away from the guy?' Their joint venture collapsed at the last moment, however, despite the pair appearing on billboards together and on the cover of Los Angeles Fashion magazine. Sambora is now dating Australian guitarist Orianthi despite a 26-year age difference. Lund's attorney declined to comment on the complaint.

Five young men were arrested Saturday in Melbourne, Australia, in what police called a major counterterrorism operation. Two of the teens, 18 and 19, have been released ""pending further inquiries,"" Australia's Federal Police said. Sevdet Besim, 18, was charged with conspiring to commit a terrorist act, and was denied bail Saturday. The person charged Monday is accused of conspiring to commit acts done in preparation for, or planning, terrorist acts. The suspects planned to attack during a major national commemoration in a week, Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Saturday. ""The act that we believe was in preparation involved attacks against police officers,"" he said. There was also a risk to the public, police said. Police said the suspects were targeting a ceremony on Anzac Day (Australia and New Zealand Army Corps Day), which is April 25 and this year is the centennial of the Gallipoli Campaign in World War I. Abbott avoided the term ISIS -- or Islamic State -- to call out those who authorities believed influenced the suspects. He instead referred to the group as the ""Daesh death cult,"" employing the acronym that is transliterated from the group's name in Arabic. It's a handle ISIS is known to loathe. Police also distanced the suspects from any ethnic connection. The men ""are individuals acting by themselves. They are not representatives of any religious, cultural or national group,"" Victoria Police Acting Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton said. ""I think the entire Australian community should be concerned about the young age of those particular men,"" Neil Gaughan, acting deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, said. ""And this is an issue not just with law enforcement, but for the broader community. ... We need to get better in relation to identifying young men and woman involved in this type of behavior, at the very early stage.""

But Malia Obama isn't your average 16-year-old: Her driving lessons were provided by the U.S. Secret Service. Asked who taught Malia how to drive, first lady Michelle Obama told celebrity chef and daytime talk-show host Rachael Ray in an interview that it was the armed agents who provide around-the-clock security for the family. Scroll down for video . Famous family: Malia Obama, seen with her mother Michelle Obama in April 2009, reportedly was taught how to drive by Secret Service agents . 'The Secret Service, actually, because they wouldn't let me in the car with her,' Mrs. Obama said in an excerpt of the interview that was released by Ray's program. The full interview is set to air Thursday. Mrs. Obama hasn't driven herself in seven or eight years, she said. She added that driving gives Malia 'a sense of normalcy,' helping her feel like the rest of her friends who are also driving. 'And my kids have got to learn how to live in the world like normal kids.' When Ray says that the Obamas seem 'so grounded,' the first lady replies that her 'hope is just to make sure that they (her daughters) come out of this thing as functioning adults, you know?' Malia also drives herself around Washington, Mrs. Obama said. 'She always has security around but in order for her to learn how to drive she had to drive on her own,' the first lady said during a separate interview on 'Live!

78b8cbcd59ba74d2e6ba11770431414a296af0fc,"A 7ft 8in tall man  so embarrassed by his height he hid at home for 'half his life' has found love with a woman three feet smaller than him. Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28, developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for years. But true  happiness eventually found the shy Brazilian - who has come to be known as 'the gentle giant' - in the form of Evem Medeiros, a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online. Scroll down for video . Half his size: Joelison Fernandes da Silva, 28 (right), who at 7ft 8in tall has come to be known as 'the gentle giant', married Evem Medeiros (left), a 5ft 21-year-old woman he met online . 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size.' The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life. 'I get asked a lot about this and at first it annoyed me but nowadays it's normal and I am used to it. I take it in good humour,' explained the real-life Goliath. 'Some people like to talk about my shoe size and then imagine how big my member might be. 'I think the size of my feet is false advertising. Our love life is normal. We adapt. Lying down everyone is my size.' Happier times: Joelison developed gigantism as a child and his rapidly soaring height forced him to drop out of school due to bullying and then refuse to leave the family house for year . Joelison grew up in a small rural village in Paraiba, northern Brazil and was bullied from a young age due to his height. He got in trouble for fighting his tormentors and later decided to quit school altogether, much to the disappointment of his mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45. She said: 'From a young age I knew there was something not quite right with Joelison. 'When he was a baby and only a few months old the baby shoes stopped fitting his feet properly and I'd always have to go and buy more and more. 'I thought ""there’s something wrong here"" but the doctors said he was just a big baby and would stop growing eventually and so we waited for him to stop growing - but he still hasn’t stopped. True love: 'The first time I saw her it was love at first sight,' Joelison said. 'I was charmed by her. I wanted to be with her all the time. It didn't matter about her size' Joelison's mother added: 'When he got to eight years old I knew he was growing at an abnormal rate and by the time he was 14 he was already 6ft 4in. 'We lived in the rural zone and nobody knew him. For half of his life he had been hidden away. If anyone came to our house he was so shy he would hide so they wouldn’t see him. 'I was really worried.' Doctors later discovered he had a benign tumour on his pituitary gland that was causing his body to produce uncontrolled amounts of growth hormone. Joelison initially refused to have it removed as he didn't want to spend three months in hospital recovering, even though he was warned it would eventually kill him. But in 2007, after some convincing from his family, he agreed and had it removed using less invasive laser surgery performed through his nose. The successful operation helped slow his growth but he still sprouted another four inches to his current height of 7ft 8in. Long and the short of it: The former gold miner admits their huge height difference has left a few people bewildered, especially when it comes to the dynamics of their love-life, which he says they have 'adapted to' With the gigantism under control, Joelison's confidence grew. The computer games fan finally took a step into the public conscience and was eventually crowned Brazil's tallest man. One TV show took such pity on his plight they made him seven pairs of shoes to fit his enormous size 23 shoe size and custom shirts and shorts to fit his bulky frame. Joelison, who used to work in a gold mine as well as a plantation before leaving due to his health issues, now makes a living appearing in commercials for frozen ready meals. As a celebrity in his homeland he began to attract admirers, including new wife Evem. She contacted him on Facebook to wish him happy birthday and they swapped numbers before starting a committed relationship two months later. Mum: Joelison's mother Ivanilde Fernandes da Silva, 45 (left), admits she's found it hard to adjust to her son's wife, claiming, 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him' 'She was basically my first woman. The first woman of my life. I was 28,' said Joelison. 'I thought everything about her was beautiful - but especially her eyes. 'She is very caring. She doesn't show it when the cameras are here but she is caring and truthful. She has never lied to me.' Just a year later they were married and it didn't take them long to start trying for a family. But Evem, who hopes to find work as a hair stylist, was initially wary of getting intimate. 'I had a certain amount of fear,' she said. 'I was afraid it wouldn't work out. But it was fine. We have a normal love life.' She added: 'We want to have a family so I track my dates, times, temperature, everything. All I have to do is call him and he understands what is going on. 'I have polycystic ovaries and so there are months that I don't ovulate. I've done my exams and already know that my condition makes it more difficult to get pregnant. 'But he hasn't done his tests so we need him to go and do it so we can see if the problem really is just me.' Joelison and Evem are currently trying to start a family, but having difficulty due to Evem's polycystic ovaries . Aside from family planning they also struggle to work together on basic chores like cooking, cleaning and shopping as Joelison's height makes it tough for him to stand up for long periods of time. His new relationship has also caused friction with his mother, who is finding it hard to let him have his independence after 28 years. She said: 'I got really jealous when he got married because I dedicated my life to him and when I had to share him with someone else it really wasn’t easy. But as a mother I want him to be happy. 'With his treatment, I’m still the one who takes care of that, I haven’t delegated it to that girl yet. 'But I will once she gets used to things.' Joelison still has monthly injections and four types of daily medication to control his condition and is likely to need even more care as he gets older. However, he has still plans to fulfil many of his dreams, including having a family and travelling abroad. He also finally finished his high-school education last year after studying at home. On top of this, he is soon due to fly to a Paris convention where he will meet others with gigantism, including the tallest man in the world, Sultan Kösen from Turkey. And Joelison, who is thought to be the third tallest man in the world, says he is looking forward to the novelty of being smaller than someone for once. 'The most interesting thing is going to be standing face to face with someone,' he said. 'The last time I did that I was a child.'

The chairman of the BBC Trust will quit her role as a director at HSBC, it was reported last night. Rona Fairhead was last month accused of being either ‘incredibly naive or totally incompetent’ by Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, over her handling of a tax evasion scandal at the bank’s Swiss division. Now, the 53-year-old has told shareholders she will stay on for ‘a further one-year period’ before leaving the bank’s board entirely, according to The Times. She announced her departure in a letter to shareholders dated on March 20. It marks a change in position for the bank, which said in its annual report that Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She had been on the board since 2004. Last night, HSBC insisted that ‘no decision has been taken at this time’. In a bruising encounter, Labour MP Mrs Hodge had told the BBC chief: ‘You should think about resigning. If not, the Government should sack you.’ Mrs Fairhead chaired HSBC’s audit committee and then its risk committee while its Swiss clients are said to have dodged tax. The bank was subsequently fined £1.2 billion for breaching American money-laundering laws. Last year, Mrs Fairhead earned more than £500,000 last year as chairwoman of HSBC’s American business. Her decision marks a change from February, when HSBC’s annual report said that despite having been on the board since 2004, Mrs Fairhead would again stand for re-election. She was appionted to her role as chairwoman of the BBC Trust in October last year for a five-year term. Mrs Fairhead suggested that ‘frontline’ staff should bear responsibility for breaching the bank’s policies, during her grilling by the public accounts committee. She said: ‘We were horrified when we discovered (what happened). I can assure you absolutely no evidence of tax evasion was received. I could only respond to evidence that I had and I could only deal with that.’ But Mrs Hodge responded that to ‘simply take the evidence and not question. . . would mean she is not fit for purpose’. Under fire: Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee (left), called on Fairhead to quit or be sacked from BBC role over her HSBC role . Her likely departure from HSBC comes as the bank is planning for a wider clearout of non-executives who have been on the board for a long period of time.","Criticised over 'incompetent' handling of bank's tax evasion scandal .

When she picked it up, infuriated, she resorted to insulting the employee's looks, intelligence, and social status. But despite viewers' calls for harsher punishment, the network has reinstated the 28-year-old to her role with a spot on SportsCenter this weekend. Confirming the news to Sports Illustrated, senior coordinating producer Seth Markman said: 'She knows she made a mistake. She’s owned up to it.

Markman insisted 'she has a lot of potential as a reporter', adding, 'she is young, she’s learning some things, but I really do believe in her.' He continued: 'We had a conversation where we both talked about that it would take time and it will be hard. She knows that, and especially at the beginning. 'She realizes she will have to do her job really well and hopefully win back some of the trust of our viewers. We expect that from her, and I expect that from her. 'She did a great job for us on the NFL last year in some difficult situations and I have seen nothing that doesn’t make me think she will rebound from this. But she knows the first couple of assignments out of the box will not be easy.' Online petitions for McHenry to be fired reached 10,000 within a day of the footage being released. The verbal attack on April 6 was captured on a security camera as she paid to pick the vehicle up at the tow lot office, where clerk Gina Michelle was stood behind the counter. 'I’m in the news, sweetheart, I will f*****g sue this place,' McHenry can he heard saying  in the video. Michelle can be heard warning McHenry she is being filmed and threatens to 'play your video'. McHenry seems unfussed, responding: 'That’s why I have a degree and you don't - I wouldn't work in a scumbag place like this.

Restaurant employees said McHenry left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere . 'Makes my skin crawl even being here.' Michelle patiently replies: 'Well let's get you out of here quickly.' McHenry then fires back: 'Yep, that's all you care about - taking people's money… with no education, no skill set. Just wanted to clarify that.' After a few more comments, including telling Michelle she doesn't have a brain, McHenry delivers her biggest sting. 'Maybe if I was missing some teeth they would hire me, huh?' she says. 'Cos I'm on television and you're in a f*****g trailer, honey.'

Hunan Number One, offers sushi, hot-wings and other bar food, along with 32oz draft beers for around $8, five-buck highballs and half-price bottles of wine, served up in front of big screen TVs playing sports.

At the same time, neither Gina, our lot clerk, nor our company, have any interest in seeing Britt McHenry suspended or terminated as a result of her comments. 'Ms McHenry is our neighbor, and, as she said, to paraphrase, made remarks that were out of line. She is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment. 'Gina is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family. Gina holds no ill will toward Ms McHenry.

Officials from the anti-racism body say they have acted on complaints from some Hartlepool fans and urged Carlisle to refuse admission to any fans who might decide to 'black up' for the occasion. Jamaican reggae artist Marley was a multi-million-selling artist, famed for his music and as a Rastafarian for his dreadlocked look, who died of cancer aged 36 in 1981. Hartlepool United fans have a history of fancy dress, travelling as the Smurfs to Charlton in 2012 . Hartlepool fans are planning to dress up as Bob Marley for the final game of this season at Carlisle . A statement from Kick It Out read: 'We have received a number of complaints from Hartlepool United supporters about the Bob Marley fancy dress theme planned by a group of the club's fans for their fixture against Carlisle United at Brunton Park on Saturday 2 May. 'The main concerns raised have been over the potential of fans deciding to 'black up'. 'We have subsequently followed up on the complaints by contacting both Hartlepool United and Carlisle United on the matter. 'We clearly outlined that 'blacking up' has historically been a way of acting out racist stereotypes, and while the theme planned by fans may be well intended and chosen as part of an annual fancy dress tradition, such behaviour, if it occurs, is likely to cause offence. 'We have provided guidance to both clubs on the matter, and advised Carlisle United of our own stance that if any fans do choose to 'black up' they should be refused entry to their stadium. Kick It Out have urged Carlisle to refuse entry to any fans who decide to black up for the fixture . 'We have also contacted the Football Association, the Football League, and the United Kingdom Football Policing Unit to inform them of the complaints we have received from Hartlepool United supporters. 'If we do receive complaints informing us that supporters have 'blacked up' at the fixture between Carlisle United and Hartlepool United, or that any incidents or disturbances of a discriminatory nature have occurred, we will follow our usual procedures by making the Football Association and the Football League aware for them to investigate.' Neither Carlisle nor Hartlepool were immediately available for comment but Carlisle boss Keith Curle told the local News & Star at a press conference this week: 'I've been to fancy dress parties when white people have dressed up as Bob Marley.

2b82bcda3b1d21e6afde258bdfd1c7de293f58f4,"They like to play a bit of Queen at Bournemouth’s little home in the minutes before their matches start. They might be better served singing The Grand Old Duke of York. Only those 10,000 men on that hill could possibly relate to the absurdities of Bournemouth’s afternoon engagement with Sheffield Wednesday. In sequence, they went from top to third to second to top to second again in the space of one 2-2 draw. They are neither up nor down; they are neither falling apart nor running away with the loot. How delightfully fitting in this remarkable season of Championship football that a team unbeaten in 10 before Saturday’s kick-off would draw at home to a side with nothing to gain or lose. Chris Maguire converts an injury time penalty so salvage a draw for Sheffield Wednesday at Dean Court . Maguire celebrates his late, late strike as the Owls held Bournemouth to a draw on their home turf . The battle for automatic promotion to the Premier League is hotting up with three points covering four teams and with two games to play. 1 Watford 85pts To play Apr 25 Brighton (a), May 2 Sheff Wed (h) 2 Bournemouth 84pts Apr 27 Bolton (h), May 2 Charlton (a) 3 Middlesbrough 84pts Apr 25 Fulham (a), May 2 Brighton (h) 4 Norwich 82pts Apr 25 Rotherham (a), May 2 Fulham (h) And how. They dominated, then they trailed, then they levelled and had a man sent off. Then their fans got mocked by a Wednesday player and then they led and then the player that did the mocking scored a penalty in stoppage time that irritated the home crowd all over again. Brilliantly bonkers. How significantly will Chris Maguire of Wednesday feature in Bournemouth’s final analysis? How serious was Eddie Howe when he indicated that the referees feel Bournemouth, at 15 kicks, have reached their quota for penalties this season? He was unhappy, to put it mildly, that Lewis Buxton was cleared of fouling Callum Wilson in the second half, telling a radio station: ‘It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said, “Don’t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don’t want them to have any more”.’ Kieran Lee (second right) celebrates with his team after his 36th minute header put the visitors ahead . He toned down his sentiments by the time he met the written press and that is probably for the best. Howe is a good and rational man; certainly one of the most upwardly mobile and promising of all English coaches. A sign of the pressure of this incredible promotion race, then? Who could blame him if it was? Middlesbrough had beaten Norwich on Friday night to take Bournemouth’s place at the top and at 3.36pm on Saturday Kieran Lee put Wednesday in front. When Craig Cathcart scored a magnificent volley for Watford against Birmingham — the only goal of the match — Watford were top and Bournemouth were third. The natives grew restless. Then Yann Kermorgant equalised, lifting Bournemouth back up to second, and a home fan screamed into a camcorder held by a policeman. Senses take leave at this time of a season, which might also explain how Simon Francis quickly landed himself a second yellow card. Maguire turned to the home fans and motioned for them to dry their eyes. Alas, Matt Ritchie then hit the top corner and put Bournemouth top again but in stoppage time Adam Smith fouled Atdhe Nuhiu for a penalty. ‘No-one will blame Adam,’ Howe said. ‘We will tell him how much we love him tonight.’ Yann Kermorgant (second left equalises for the Cherries with 20 minutes of the contest remaining . Bournemouth's Simon Francis is dismissed by referee Paul Tierney in the 78th minute . Which is nice, though Maguire did score the penalty and Bournemouth did fall. Again. Howe said he felt ‘heartbroken’. Over the course of two spells at Bournemouth he has led them from League Two to this precipice, occasionally spending his own money in the darker days when the club was broke. Today, in their tiny stadium where parking costs £1 and stewards are encouraged to say hello, they are so close to something incredible. Tommy Elphick, Bournemouth’s captain, gave something of an insight into what his manager has been going through. ‘He is probably the first one every day in at 6 or 7 and probably leaving at 6 or 7 at night and the players follow suit,’ he said. ‘We realise how much he does for us. When a single person gives that much of their life towards you, you only want to repay them.’ But the best intentions can only do so much in a race like this. Promotion is worth somewhere in the region of £120million and, as of the weekend, eight teams are in the hunt for three spots. Multiple narratives, multiple charges and multiple futures on the line. It’s crazy but it’s brilliant. With only two games to play it has been a magnificent race up the hill.

691bac0b53a908837ea2ef0d2d7c5c4e5c3a43d2,"A New York City skin clinic's popular new laser treatment promises to tighten skin and improve complexion - if clients are brave enough to sign a waiver releasing their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner first. Manhattan-based Skin Laundry says that after just ten minutes, their Light and Laser procedure will leave your skin 'glowing', while also promising that long-term use will reduce wrinkles, clear acne, and minimize scarring. With these claims, the quickie treatment seems perfect on paper - unless that paper is in the mandatory eight-page contract that one client told the New York Post was like 'a Dickens novel', and includes wording that prepares for the possible death of the client. But that hasn't stopped skin-obsessed New Yorkers from flocking to the Manhattan location. Scroll down for video . Risky regimen: To get Skin Laundry's popular laser facial, clients must sign a waiver that releases their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner . 'Although rare, potential risks include blistering, crusting, itching, pain, bruising, skin whitening and/or hyperpigmentation, burns, infection, scabbing, scarring and swelling,' reads the waiver clients sign on an iPad before beginning their treatments. Then, of course, there are the more fatal risks. Clients also agree to release their personal information to a funeral director and a coroner 'for identification purposes', as well as grant permission for their organs to be donated. Yet despite such ominous language, fans of the 'addictive' procedure seem undeterred. In fact, the clinic has even had to extend its hours in order to accommodate all of its bookings - and frequent visitors are known to bring in cookies for the staff to thank them for doing such a good job. 'You can say I’m hooked,' Josh Hatfield, 27, told the Post, adding that he's been to the clinic about 20 times so far. At $100 a pop, that's some pretty pricey skin 'maintenance', as Mr. Hatfield calls it. For regulars like him, however, Skin Laundry offers bulk-buy packages that are sold at a discount; Mr. Hatfield has a $360-per-month membership that grants him eight treatments. Booming business: The New York location is the sixth for Skin Laundry, which also has clinics in California and Arizona . 'We're the future of facials,' said founder Yen Reis, 36, who gets the treatment two or three times a week herself. This particular facial is a two-step process, which the clinic says provides a deep clean for skin. Clients don protective goggles as a nurse runs a laser over their faces twice. Gel is slathered on the skin, followed by a pulsed light also applied by the nurse. In addition to the slightly troubling legal documents each client is required to sign, the treatment itself is not completely free from unpleasant side effects – including an unpleasant smell which a number of clients noted during their first treatment. 'The laser's cleaning your face. It's deep cleansing,' a nurse explains to blogger Carla Mickelborg in a video Carla took during her treatment. 'So that's what your're smelling.' Clients may not feel the need to worry about suspicious smells and potential health risks however because, despite the necessity of the waiver, there have been no reported deaths from the procedure so far. There have, though, been several claims that the treatment works, and word of mouth has proven a powerful promoter of its benefits. Skin spa: Clients of Skin Laundry's facial lay down while a nurse uses a laser and pulsing light on their skin . Her own biggest fan: Founder Yen Reis, pictured, says she gets her company's signature skin treatment two to three times a week . 'If I hadn’t had [my friend’s] testimonial beforehand, I may have backed out [when I saw the waiver],' said beauty blogger Amber Katz. Jacqueline Caterina, 33, added that she has seen an improvement to her acne scars since starting to regularly visit Skin Therapy: 'After a couple of weeks I was like, ""Wow!""' However,  NYC-based plastic surgeon Dr. Norman Rowe told the Post that he questions the effectiveness of the treatments, noting that they aren't very powerful if clients need to go so frequently. Still, Skin Therapy does have a number of regular customers, allowing the company to expand to a total of six locations, with four in California and one in Scottsdale, Arizona.","Skin Laundry, a trendy new skin clinic in Manhattan, offers a ten-minute laser facial which promises to tighten skin .

Ozil was off the pace at the beginning of this season, but says he is now back to his best since returning to fitness in January. And the German star says his injury has actually helped him, claiming that it 'worked in my favour' after a busy schedule. Mesut Ozil trains ahead of Arsenal's FA Cup semi final against Reading on Saturday . The German star says he is now playing his best football since joining the Gunners in the summer of 2013 . Ozil said 10 years of playing football had taken their toll, but he has come to terms with the Premier League . Mesut Ozil is interviewed in this week's Sport . 'At the moment I am pleased with the consistency of my game,' Ozil told Sport magazine. 'I feel I am now playing my best football since joining Arsenal.' The playmaker was a big part of Germany's World Cup win over the summer, playing every game as Joachim Low's side lifted the trophy in Brazil, and the process took a lot out of him. 'I was exhausted at the start of the season,' he confesses. 'I started playing professional football at the age of 16 and had never really suffered many serious injuries. ' I guess 10 years of consistently playing football took its toll. I was also struggling with the physicality of this league.' However, Ozil has bounced back in the second half of this season, his excellent form coinciding with a winning run that has seen the Gunners climb the table. And the 26-year-old midfielder has attributed his success, in part, to the injury that kept him out for three months this winter. Ozil celebrates scoring a goal in the convincing win against Liverpool, when he was in excellent form . Ozil has put his improved performances down to the strength training he went through after being injured . 'The injury worked in my favour in a way, as it gave me time to recover, to assess and to work on what was required to compete in this league,' he added. 'The football here is far more physical, it is played at a faster tempo and you have to adapt to the sheer number of games. 'I have had to work a lot harder and adjust my game accordingly. I used my time out with injury to work on my strength. I'm continuing to do extra sessions after training now.'

dd7200d8975b2f30512d4b813b123b8d54330b47,"A former mob enforcer in Rhode Island with ties to late New England crime boss Raymond L.S. Patriarca has died in a federal prison in North Carolina. Gerard T. 'The Frenchman' Ouimette was 75. The Federal Bureau of Prison's website reported that Ouimette, who had lived in Fall River, Massachusetts, died Sunday. Ouimette, suspected of having a role in up to eight murders, 'ran' the federal prison in North Carolina in the 1970s and even had booze, drugs and lobster dinner smuggled in on a weekly basis, according to a Rhode Island State Police report. His nephew, Kevin Ouimette Lynch, tells the Providence Journal that his uncle was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and died in his sleep at a prison in Butner, North Carolina. Ouimette was reportedly in control of a gangster network responsible for gambling, loansharking, extortion, and murder, among other crimes . Ouimette passed away in this medium security facility after being diagnosed with lung cancer . In 1996, Ouimette was convicted of extortion and became the first criminal in New England sentenced to life in prison under the federal 'three strikes and you're out' provision for violent offenders. Ouimette had more than 10 convictions during his criminal career, including one for punching an FBI agent. The Providence Journal reports that Ouimette spent a total of 46 years behind bars. A 1979 FBI document regarding his background paints the picture of man in control of a massive underworld network. 'Subject OUIMETTE controls a large group of criminals known as the OUIMETTE faction, whose criminal activities include gambling, loansharking, extortion and property violations such as major hijackings, robberies and burglaries,' the report states. Ouimette had close ties to crime boss Raymond Patriarca, seen here leaving a federal building in Boston on June 27, 1967. 'Although not Italian, OUIMETTE enjoys the same stature as lieutenants under RAYMOND L.S. PATRIARCA, who controls organized crime (OC) in the Boston and New England area.' The document went on to call Ouimette responsible for 'seven of eight gangland-style murders.' He was never convicted of any homicides, however. Ouimette was known to his associates as 'The Frenchman.' In his 2012 memoir, 'What Price Providence,' the enforcer blamed the police for the nickname. ''The Frenchman' is the name that Rhode Island police attached to me in 1969 since I am proud of my French descent, an anomaly in that neighborhood,' he wrote. 'Due to ensuing notoriety, the name stuck.' In the introduction to that back, he wrote that he knew he would die in prison. 'There is a saying that is appropriate to prison life: 'If you sit by the river long enough, you will eventually see all your enemies float by,'' he wrote. 'Bottom line is, if you can survive, you're ahead of the game, not by much, but by some. The reason is, there is no room for error when you are playing the La Costra Nostra's major leagues; one mistake can end your life, and often does.' The gangland enforcer's influence was not diminished behind bars, and state police said he even became the boss of the ACI's maxium security prison in the 1970s. At least once a week in the latter years of that decade, gang associate Charles 'The Ghost' Kennedy would visit the facility with as much as $600 worth of alcohol, marijuana, ham, cold cuts, cheese, and Italian bread for security guards to deliver to the incarcerated Ouimette and his gang. They even had catered lobster dinners, police said. Ouimette, then 55, is seen here being escorted out of Federal Court in Providence, Rhode Island, after being sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 . Besides booze, Ouimette even once had his son, then only five-years-old, smuggled into the prison for a sleepover, the Journal reported. Eventually he and Kennedy had a falling out, and Kennedy claimed a hit squad was assembled to kill him. A fearful man, during his 1996 exortion trial several strippers who were called to testify about threats Ouimette had made in their club broke down in tears before him in court. Ouimette's body will be sent back to Rhode Island where Ouimette will be buried.","Gerard T. Ouimette, 75, known as 'The Frenchman,' died in medium security federal pen in his sleep .

5bf656b9bc77d95d009faa17ea8cee6abf64b5d1,"Jamie Carragher says Mike Ashley has turned Newcastle United into a ‘boring’ club and has accused the billionaire owner of only being interested in making money. His words are sure to resonate with supporters who boycotted Sunday’s 3-1 defeat at home to Spurs – a sixth straight loss which equals their worst-ever run in the Premier League. Before the game fans gathered outside the Gallowgate End and were united in choruses of ‘We’re rich but our team is s***’ and ‘Where’s the money gone?’ in protest at Ashley’s running of the club, which this month returned record profits of £18.7million and later revealed they have £34m sat in the bank. Mike Ashley has been accused of making Newcastle a 'boring' club because he only wants to make money . Carragher, too, is alarmed at what has become of Newcastle. ‘I can understand why fans are frustrated,’ said the Sportsmail columnist in his punditry role on Sky Sports. ‘It’s getting to the stage now, football is so big and there’s that much money coming in to the game with the new TV deal, I am sick of owners coming in who are successful business people wherever they’ve been. They think “Where else can I make money? Oh a football club”. ‘I’ve had it at my own club Liverpool with George Gillett and Tom Hicks and it’s the same at Newcastle. Jamie Carragher slammed the chairman and says he's alarmed at the state Newcastle are currently in . ‘People will say as supporters you’ve got to come back, you’ve got to get behind your team. But what are the owners doing for supporters? ‘Since Mike Ashley’s been here they’ve been relegated once and they could be relegated once again. ‘So he’s balanced the books - he’s made money because he’s a businessman - but I think of these people and wonder, “Don’t you want to be excited yourself?”. ‘I’m getting bored by Newcastle. When you watched them over the years there was madness, there was excitement, stupid goals going in one end and then the other, but it was exciting. ‘Now it’s boring. Why does Mike Ashley want the club if there’s nothing happening? There’s no cup run, I just don’t get it. I don’t get why he wants to own a football club.’ Meanwhile, former Sunderland chairman Niall Quinn says Ashley must try to reconnect with the club’s fans. Thousands of fans chose to boycott the Tottenham game in protest of Mike Ashley's tenure at the club . Some fans that did go to St. James' Park showed their disgust in the stadium with banners and posters . There was blocks of empty seats where fans chose not to attend the 3-1 loss to the London side . ‘I think you’ve got to get the balance right. It’s not just about making money,’ he said. ‘Early on in his tenure here he was getting criticism and he made his mind up he was doing it his way and he didn’t care what the fans thought. And that is something that just doesn’t work. ‘Sunderland fans will resent me for saying this, but the Geordie fans have been through everything with this football club, and for them to stay away and not watch a game of football at this club - that hurts. It tells of the disconnect and it has to be resolved. ‘To reconnect has to be the best way forward.’ Thousands of posters were created by Ashleyout.com and passed around the city prior to the game .","Jamie Carragher has slammed Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley .

af607233559f42e897f7c8d5ef44cd112715d955,"Two men who claim they were molested as young boys by Michael Jackson are expected to find out on Tuesday if they will be allowed to sue  for a slice of the late King Of Pop's $1.5 billion estate. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once the singer's staunchest defender, now claims Jackson was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff has scheduled a hearing for Robson and another of Jackson's alleged child victims, James Safechuck, on Tuesday that could decide if their respective claims proceed. Australian choreographer Wade Robson, once Michael Jackson's staunchest defender, now claims the singer was a predator who repeatedly sexually abused him as a child . Robson and Safechuck missed a statutory deadline when they filed their claims more than a year after Jackson's 2009 death. If Judge Beckloff gives Robson, 32, and Safechuck, 36, a green light to proceed with their civil claim, new child molestation allegations will likely be revealed in court against Jackson. Lawyers say the King Of Pop shelled out nearly $200 million to as many as 20 victims, reports the New York Post. The Jordan Chandler lawsuit alone is alleged to have cost more than $40 million. Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride. Safechuck alleges the singer gave him a marriage certificate and a wedding band as keepsakes and confirmation of their 'undying love'. He also alleges that Jackson wrote a check for more than $1 million to Safechuck's father, a sanitation worker. James Safechuck, who says he met Jackson in 1987 when he was eight and was molested a year later, claims in court filings that Jackson held a secret wedding ceremony with a young Safechuck as his bride . 'Jackson was successful in his efforts to the point that my client endured repeated acts of sexual abuse of a heinous nature and was brainwashed... into believing they were acts of love and ­instigated by James himself,' Safechuck's attorneys said in the ­filings. The singer regularly dressed Safe­chuck in clothes identical to his and would tell reporters Safechuck was his cousin, a former employee said. Safechuck's attorney alleges that Jackson molested Safechuck more than 100 times. Robson was a five-year-old dance prodigy in Brisbane, Australia, when he first met the singer. Prior to filing his civil lawsuit in 2013 he had been one of the pop star's biggest supporters, including testifying under oath at Jackson's 2005 molestation trial in California he was never abused by Jackson. Robson was a key reason for Jackson's acquittal. He now says he 'lived in silence and denial for 22 years' and alleges he was seven years old when Jackson first molested him. Former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, left, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw them semi-nude in bed together . Robson accuses Jackson of first molesting him at the Neverland Ranch, while his sister slept in a separate bed just metres away. A former Jackson maid, Blanca Francia, is expected to testify that she walked in on the singer showering with and groping the then nine-year-old Robson and that she saw Jackson and Robson semi-nude in bed together, the Post reports. The estate has previously asked the court to reject the claims on the basis that Robson waited too long to file and because Jackson is the only other person with knowledge about the accusations and has been dead for more than five years. Robson, a choreographer for Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, says he has been unable to work because of the pain caused by Jackson's abuse. Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest.","Wade Robson and James Safechuck hope to find out on Tuesday if they can bring a civil lawsuit against the late singer's estate .

1ae7d8c3af1fa0b0a0a7d9fcb61b21336188ee8c,"A barrister and Oxford University graduate who spent more than two years avoiding paying for his train ticket could be the biggest fare-dodger to be prosecuted, a court heard. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over a two-and-a-half year period. He travelled from his Oxfordshire home to London Marylebone but pretended to have only gone from Wembley, in north west London. Peter Barnett, 43, is said to have caused a loss of £23,000 to Chiltern Railways over two-and-a-half years . Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year . The Australian-born lawyer argues that he only dodged up to £9,714.40 in fares, claiming the amount should be based on the cost of a weekly ticket, and take into account annual leave. But prosecutor Malachy Pakenham told Westminster Magistrates' Court: 'If it is accepted that the loss was £23,000, this defendant would be convicted of the biggest rail evasion case that has come to the court in the United Kingdom. 'The Crown have reached that figure by a number of rail staff calculating it. 'The train company are experts, not me or my friend and they have calculated it on a basis that if someone commits a fraud like this defendant has committed, you are not allowed to calculate it on the basis of a weekly ticket, you calculate it on a full single fare, of the return for the day, each and every day this defendant travelled over the period without a full price rail ticket'. Barnett admits six counts of fraud by false representation between April 2012 and November last year. Barnett claimed to have travelled from Wembley, in North West London, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire . The scam began to unravel for Barnett when he was stopped by a ticket inspector at Marylebone last November. The Rhodes scholar claimed to have travelled from Wembley, instead of Thame, Oxfordshire, where he and his wife live in a £550,000 five-bedroom detached home. Barnett was sent to the excess fares window but another member of staff became suspicious and decided to contact his supervisor. When he turned his back Barnett ran away, but was apparently overcome with guilt and confessed the next day. An investigation was carried out by British Transport Police, which found the lawyer had dodged fares since April 2012. The lawyer was cautioned for an identical offence in 2010 but continued to break the law, despite his prestigious reputation as the founder of an African children's charity and director of leading think-tank, the Legatum Institute Foundation, aimed at 'promoting prosperity'. A court heard how the barrister got off at London Marylebone (pictured) by tapping out with an Oyster card . It is understood he did so by boarding a train at Haddenham and Thame Parkway without a ticket, and then getting off at Marylebone by simply tapping out with an Oyster card. Because there was no start point to his journey, the automated system charged him the maximum Transport for London fare, which is currently £7.60. But this is still far less than the £19.80 price of a single peak time journey from his home. The case was adjourned until July 27 so a hearing can be held to determine the loss caused to Chiltern Railways. Barnett was released on unconditional bail. The deception places him among the ranks of Britain's biggest fare dodgers, closely behind a former millionaire fund manager. Jonathan Burrows was banned from working in the City last year after avoiding £43,000 in train fares from his home in Stonegate, East Sussex. Burrows had hoped to keep his name out of the public eye and avoid prosecution by quickly reimbursing Southeastern trains the full amount in unpaid tickets, accrued over five years, within three days of being caught.","Peter Barnett, 43, travelled from Haddenham and Thame to Marylebone .

Residents of rural towns like Cumnock, Errowanbang and Molong in NSW and Wicheproof in Victoria hope the bargain rentals will entice families with young children who can help populate their schools, save the local bus run and keep businesses open. Cumnock resident Christine Weston says the Rent-a-farmhouse initiative she set up in 2008 brought new life to her town of 280 people near Orange The town's population increased 30 per cent but those families are growing up and moving on. 'Country life still appeals to many families, but it doesn’t always make financial sense for them. We’re trying to change that,' Ms Westone told the Daily Telegraph.

Scarlett's parents helped renovate the old 'Barina' homestead while renting the property for $1 a week . This farmhouse in Wycheproof, a wheat town  northwest of Melbourne, was leased for $1 a week in a bid to boost enrolments at the  local school and sports club . 'We offer $1 rent on the condition that the families who move in have kids, but can also contribute to bush communities with skills we’re short of,' Ms Weston said. Ms Weston says some farmhouses are being offered at  low rent because they need renovating. Others need a caretaker to look after the farm and some need skilled labour to help during busy harvest times and others need children to save the school bus run. Everyone is welcome to apply. The Mercer's country home called 'Barina' which is part of the Rentafarmhouse scheme . Cumnock was the first town to implement the Rentafarmhouse project but more than 20 rural communities from WA, Victoria, Tasmania and NSW have benefited from taking part in similar $1-a-week schemes. The sheep shearing town of Errowanbang, near Orange, saw its school enrolments increase 300 per cent after  residents started leasing properties to new families for next to nothing. In Rugby, 200kms south-west of Sydney, a school was saved. Its student  numbers had dwindled to two. Some of the $1-a-week farmhouses are rundown and in need of renovation, others need a caretaker for the farm or children in the community to keep local schools running .

Knievel, 52, was speeding in an SUV on Tuesday evening when he rear-ended a Honda, causing a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles, police said. No one was injured. After the crash, Knievel drove off but his car was found nearby and he was seen walking about a block away, according to Butte-Silver Bow Undersheriff George Skuletich. In court: Robbie Knievel, pictured in court on Wednesday, was arrested for DUI in Montana after crashing into another car on Tuesday evening and setting off a chain-reaction crash involving two other cars . Officers noticed that he had a bloody lip and smelled of alcohol, but he refused to perform a breath test and so officers got a search warrant to take a blood sample, the Montana Standard reported. Knievel was booked into jail. On Wednesday, he made his initial appearance in Justice Court. He has been in the area, where he has family, for a couple of weeks, authorities said. Skuletich says Knievel invoked his rights to an attorney but didn't give officers a name. The son of the famous daredevil Evel Knievel has previously admitted to being an alcoholic and pleaded guilty to DUI in South Dakota in August 2013. Like father like son: Robbie is pictured jumping 21 Hummers at Texas Motor Speedway in June 2008 . Icon: American daredevil and entertainer Evel Knievel poses for a portrait before a stunt in 1976 . In that incident, he drove his vehicle into two motor homes as he left a campground and a blood-alcohol test suggested he was nearly three times the legal limit. He received a suspended jail sentence and paid nearly $600 in fines. His driver's license was also suspended for 30 days. Following the arrest, he spoke with 'TMZ Live' and admitted that he had an alcohol problem. 'I'm a frickin' drinking, driving daredevil,' he told the show. 'I ride motorcycles and I friggn' drink and ride … that's my deal.' They also asked him how he would feel if he hurt someone while he was behind the wheel. 'I shouldn't be drinking and driving 'cause I could kill somebody,' he said. 'And you know what, it would be better if I killed myself.' Together: The two Knievels are pictured together in 2006 - the year before Evel passed away, aged 69 . Knievel appeared in his father's stunts as a child and has continued working as a daredevil in his own right, while his older brother, Kelly, overseas the Knievel brand. Among his most famous stunts, Robbie Knievel, a father-of-two, jumped over the Grand Canyon in May 1999 - succeeding where his father had failed years earlier. To complete the jump, which was televised by Fox, he soared 228 feet (69 meters) across a narrow part of the canyon on his a 500 cc motorcycle. Evel Knievel, who famously jumped lines of cars and buses, and attempted to hurdle sharks, canyons and anything else, passed away in 2007, aged 69.","The daredevil, 52, 'was speeding in an SUV when he rear-ended a car and set off a chain-reaction crash involving two other vehicles on Tuesday'

a587bd4ad3b944a599468d9afb5c2ec54ae10994,"Fresh testimonies from a small island community in the Maldives has reignited reports that missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 could have crashed  over 5000 kilometres away from the official search led by Australian authorities. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo, located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll in the Maldives, reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year, when the flight disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. The reports come as acoustic scientists from Curtin University refuse to rule out the possibility that 'distinctive' data they recorded from the area at the assumed time of the crash may have come from the impact of the aircraft as it hit the Indian Ocean. Locals from the island of Kudahuvadhoo in the Maldives reported witnessing 'a low-flying jumbo jet' on the morning of March 8 last year when MH370 disappeared . Kudahuvadhoo is located in the southern area of the Dhaalu Atoll, in the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean . Despite an exhaustive search that is underway along a 600 square kilometre arc approximately 1800 kilometres southwest of Perth, locals from the island believe they identified red and blue markings, similar to those of the missing plane, on a large passenger jet which flew over the island on the morning of the MH370's disappearance, reported The Weekend Australian. Villagers from the community of 3500 claim that many on the island saw the passenger plane, and were interviewed by police and testified with signed statements to what they witnessed. 'I'm very sure of what I saw on a very clear and bright day, and what I saw was not normal- the plane was very big, and low. I did not know until later that other people saw it too. I don't know if it's the Malaysia plane', said Ahmed Shiyaam, 34, an IT manager. Abdu Rasheed Ibrahim said he saw the plane flying towards him over the water, and did not know at the time that it could be the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. 'I didn't know that a plane was missing. I went straight home and told my wife about it. I told my family, ""I saw this strange plane"". This is the biggest plane I have ever seen from this island...I have seen pictures of the missing plane- I believe I saw the plane...I strongly felt those people who were searching should come here,' Mr Ibrahim said. The Maldvies National Defence Force released a statement in March last year which denied that there had been any aircrafts in the area at the time of the disappearance, which locals have branded as an attempt to hide the limitations of their radar facilities. A local media outlet reported that witnesses claimed the plane was travelling north to southeast, and that the plane was travelling so low it's doors could be seen. 'I've never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We've seen seaplanes, but I'm sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly,' an eyewitness told the website. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board . The search for the missing plane has been headed up by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre . The search has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia . 'It's not just me either, several other residents have reported seeing the exact same thing. Some people got out of their houses to see what was causing the tremendous noise too.' The plane dropped off the civilian radar after its transponder and other equipment were switched off shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. It was then tracked by Malaysia’s military radar heading towards the Indian Ocean. Over the past year, the search for the missing plane by the Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre, headed by Australia, has focused on 60,000 square kilometres of deep ocean off the coast of Western Australia. The location of the search was primarily calculated by sophisticated satellite technology which recorded 'pings' or 'electronic handshakes' sent between MH370 and a satellite for the final hours of it's journey. The flight made a number of unexplained deviations, and flew for several hours in radio silence after it lost contact with Air Traffic Control while flying between Malaysia and Vietnam. As of early March 40 per cent of the area had been scrutinised, but there have been no sightings of debris on the surface or any clues that the aircraft is lying on the sea bed in region covered so far. 'Based on all available data as well as circumstances ... survivability in the defined area is highly unlikely. It is therefore with the heaviest heart and deepest sorrow that we officially declare Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 an accident,' said Malaysia's civil aviation chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman.

Dr Alec Duncan (left) from Curtin University's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal . The signal was recorded west of Rottnest Island using acoustic recorders (above) at 1:30 am on March 8 . The reports from Kudahuvadhoo follow information released from Curtin University  that a 'clear acoustic signal' was recorded at a time reasonably consistent with the timeline of the plane's disappearance. Dr Alec Duncan and his associates from the university's Centre for Marine Science and Technology began investigating a low-frequency underwater sound signal which was recorded west of Rottnest Island just after 1:30 am UTC on March 8. The Centre, along with United Nations’ Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO) and Geoscience Australia were involved in investigating data that might prove helpful to the search, and originally determined that the noise's source was close to the Maldives and Kudahuvadhoo. 'Data from one of the IMOS (Integrated Marine Observing System) recorders showed a clear acoustic signal at a time that was reasonably consistent with other information relating to the disappearance of MH370,' Dr Duncan said in a statement released by Curtin University. An Indian sand artist created a message of prayer for the missing crew and passengers of the flight . Relatives of the missing passengers of flight MH370 visit a temple in China to pray for their family members . Relatives of passengers of the flight are told the news that MH370 plunged into the sea on March 24, 2014 . 'The crash of a large aircraft in the ocean would be a high energy event and expected to generate intense underwater sounds.' Dr Duncan said that the noise may have been due to a geological event, including a small earth tremor, but the timing piqued the interest of his research team. 'It would be more correct to say that our team has identified an approximate possible location for the origin of a noise that is probably of geological origin, but cannot be ruled out as being connected with the loss of MH370,' he told The Weekend Australian. In early March, Malaysia's transport minister, Liow Tiong Lai, said that data will be re-examined and a new plan formulated if the plane is not found by the end of May. It is one year since Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 went missing. Here is a timeline of the main events over the last 12 months. 2014 . 2015 .","Locals from the Maldives island of Kudahuvadhoo claim they saw a low-flying jet on the morning MH370 disappeared .

Since returning home from our kickoff weekend where we got to experience life as a full-time triathlete, I've been juggling training life with a full-time job, hectic commute and time with friends and family. With my Fit Nation teammates spread far and wide, this was a solo effort. Throw in a notorious Chicago winter that refused to go gently into that good night, and I'll admit it: I was not very diligent in getting all of my training done. ""Partner up,"" the Facebook status read. Jae Rockwell, the founder of my local women's fitness groups, Women RUN the World, posted this mantra to help us keep ourselves accountable. And so that's what I did. I'm lucky to count a handful of both experienced and aspiring triathletes among my friends. So, I reached out to them to ask what they were up to. Annastasia W., who's training for her first Ironman half-triathlon this summer, suggested a group brick workout at our local gym. She invited several other women, including complete newbies, through the SoleTri Sisters Facebook group and 10 of us met up on a cold Chicago morning to swim for 15 minutes, bike for 30 minutes and run for 15 minutes. That was great motivation to keep up with my workouts for the next week. A few weeks later, I traveled to Little Rock, Arkansas, to run a marathon. I traveled to Little Rock with three phenomenal ""fitspirations"": Samantha Goga, Natali Villarruel and Umber Rahman -- who are members of an obstacle course race group called the Midwest Vikings. Seeing how much fun they've had participating in some really daunting physical challenges helped me push through some of the more difficult moments of running my first marathon! Swimming remains my weakest link. I just learned to swim last summer. Sometimes I forget that and don't cut myself any slack or recognize how far I've come. Once my formal swim class ended in February I found myself seriously slacking on my swim training. Enter my swim angels, Lovie Twine and Eanista Bailey. They took me out into Lake Michigan last year after my first swim class was complete for a celebratory ""swim"" (which was really just wading). It was great to have them join me for a swim workout. I appreciated their perspective and gentle coaching. And you know what was happening while I was partnering up? Spring was on the way! And that meant I could finally break free of my Computrainer bike sessions and hit the road. I was lucky enough to connect with the Major Taylor Cycling Club of Chicago (MTC3) for a series of novice rides they've been hosting on local trails around Chicagoland. With two falls behind me (hey, those clips take some getting used to), we got in nearly 23 miles and a new addiction was born. Riding outside with the wind whipping your face, chasing your friends and breathing fresh air is exhilarating and I'm looking forward to many more rides outdoors. I want to say thank you to the fellowship of fitness that I've been lucky enough to find. There are so many others we keep me inspired, accountable and motivated. I'm so grateful that they keep me moving in the right direction and I hope that I can help others do the same. So when times get tough, partner up!",Working out in a group of friends inspired Fit Nation participant Erica Moore .

The 23-year-old Serbian-born fashion star, who appears in a solo editorial in the May issue of Vogue, told the publication that she was advised not to undergo her gender reassignment surgery because it would transform her from an interesting enigma into just another pretty girl. Andreja noted that there were people who warned her not to transition, explaining: ‘There was definitely a lot of, ""Oh, you’re going to lose what’s special about you. You’re not going to be interesting anymore. There are loads of pretty girls out there.""' Scroll down for video . Fashion pioneer: Transgender model Andreja Pejic posed for photographer Patrick Demarchelier for a spread in Vogue. The 23-year-old revealed to the magazine that she is the new face of Make Up For Ever . Major debut: The model, who underwent gender-confirmation surgery last year, took to the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show in February (pictured) One agent even told her that 'it's better to be androgynous than a tranny', but Andreja refused to fall prey to those opinions. 'It is about showing that this is not just a gimmick,' she said of being transgender. Andreja also revealed during the interview that she has been signed as the newest face for beauty brand Make Up For Ever, and is thought to be the first ever transgender model to land a major cosmetics campaign. And her success is, she hopes, a sign that there is a cultural shift occurring within the industry when it comes to gender identity. 'There are just more categories now,' she told Vogue. 'It’s good. We’re finally figuring out that gender and sexuality are more complicated.' Andreja was born in what is now known as Bosnia-Herzegovina and later to emigrated to Melbourne, Australia. She grew up as a boy named Andrej, although she admitted that she was unsure where she fit in during her adolescence. She even considered being gay, but explains that even that 'didn't fit', saying: 'Society doesn’t tell you that you can be trans.' Andreja recalled wanting to 'stop puberty in its early tracks' because she was worried about her jawline becoming too strong and her feet and hands growing too large . Fashion friends: Andreja posted this picture of herself posing alongside Kendall Jenner while the pair were backstage at the Giles  show . Two worlds: Before her sex reassignment procedure, Andreja made a name for herself as both a male and female model, having modeled menswear (L) and womenswear (R) for Jean Paul Gaultier . But at 6'1, Andreja, who also wears a size 11 shoe, fits in perfectly with her fellow models. On her first modeling gig she looked around the room and told herself she didn't need to worry because 'every girl in fashion is exactly the same'. Before undergoing her sex reassignment surgery, Andreja made a name for herself within the fashion industry as both a male and a female model, with her androgynous look allowing her to showcase both male and female designs. She modeled Jean Paul Gaultier's Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2012 collection in Paris in July 2012, before going on to showcase the same designer's menswear range as part of Paris Fashion Week in January 2013. She took the runway for the first time as a woman during designer Giles Deacon's Autumn/Winter 2015 show show at London Fashion Week in February. And her new cosmetics campaign is just the latest means of her continuing to break boundaries – something which is already being echoed throughout the fashion industry by many other models. Last month, it was announced that transgender teen Jazz Jennings, 14, would be the new face of skincare brand Clean & Clear's new 'See The Real Me' campaign.

dfea7a09613642f43b58623e0557bfeb8fccc1bd,"(CNN)If there was ever any doubt that the Obama administration's Clean Power Plan is an energy policy plan, not a carbon reduction plan, all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy. Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity.   Surely President Barack Obama's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing the United States' overall carbon emissions, would revitalize the nuclear industry, lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets. Well, think again. James Hansen, the former head of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said in 2013 that ""continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."" Yet Wednesday, the White House will celebrate Earth Day and promote its work to fend off climate change, while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration's favorite climate scientists. Despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free, the Obama administration's energy policy plan is biased against it.  This bias is created by how Environmental Protection Agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation.  EPA's modeling is divorced from reality. First, EPA's ""Base Case for the Proposed Clean Power Plan"" purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the Clean Power Plan.  This base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050. EPA's implementation modeling, ""Option 1 -- State,""  shows exactly the same situation: no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050.  In other words, EPA assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050. These assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets. A group of University of Tennessee graduate students made this point to EPA at a public hearing last summer. Using EPA's own data, the graduate students showed that EPA's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants.  The students demonstrated that under this scenario, EPA's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase. President Obama's EPA has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model. For example, when EPA modeled the Lieberman-Warner bill in 2008, the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill. EPA's modeling of the 2009 Waxman-Markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation. Where did this policy shift come from? At a recent hearing in the Environment and Public Works Committee, Mary Nichols, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, told Congress that EPA looked at California's California Global Warming Solutions Act when developing its so-called Clean Power Plan and that EPA's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free. Thus, EPA is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others. Congress did not give EPA the authority to make these choices, so instead they have hidden them in the modeling. For example, the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050.  This is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement. This anti-nuclear bias also is evident in Obama's recent executive order ""Planning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade,"" which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions. Even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity, the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors. While I have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon, I believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security, and I have supported legislation that helps to clean the air. The administration says it shares these same interests, despite differing avenues to get there.  The administration also believes in man-driven global warming, which should make nuclear energy its golden key. But the Clean Power Plan and the President's recent executive order demonstrate that the Obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy. If you think this administration supports nuclear energy, think again.","U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe: Nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy, generating over 60% of our carbon-free electricity .
So why doesn't the President's climate plan, allegedly aimed at reducing carbon emissions, do more with nuclear power?"

Since announcing his intention to retire in February, McCoy has enjoyed a farewell tour up and down the country as well as travelling over to Ireland, with the attendance at usually mundane midweek meetings boosted by his presence. The adulation shown to him has made the 20-times champion jockey realise just how much he affected the lives of the racing fraternity but while the decision to quit seemed to some to come out of the blue, McCoy feels he owes it to his family to go out at the top. Tony McCoy holds the jockeys championship trophy he won for the 20th  time on the day he retires . Northern Irishman McCoy shows his emotion at Sandown Park after the final race of his career . McCoy says the response to his retirement announcement has made his final months in the saddle easier . Speaking to At The Races on the first morning he could no longer call himself a jockey he said: 'We had a very good night but I've just got up and haven't got round to eating breakfast yet. I can smell it, though, and someone has done the right thing and cooked me a nice breakfast. 'It was very difficult to take it all in yesterday, the crowd, the people round the parade ring, the great racing public came out in force and I was very flattered and honoured by it all. 'To get a reception like that for doing something I've loved to do for pretty much all my life, I'm really going to miss it. 'I told all the lads yesterday to enjoy it while you're doing it because the end comes quickly. 'It's very nice to feel that I have the respect of people up and down the country. For the last 21 years I've ridden up and down the country pretty much full on but over the last two and a half months people have come out to give me a wonderful welcome and I'm very grateful of that. 'It would be very difficult not to notice how that has developed and I'd like to thank all those people for coming out and making the last few months of my career so special and making it a little bit easier.

McCoy stands with his wife Chanelle and children Eve and Archie with the trophy he's won 20 times in a row . McCoy waves goodbye to the fans who line the fence and pack the racecourse to see his final ride . McCoy said he had initially thought he could go quietly on his final day at Sandown but his agent Dave Roberts helped him come to the decision of making the announcement early and giving racing fans a chance to say their farewells. 'When I decided to retire I always thought I'd go to Sandown on the last day and say 'thanks very much' but having spoken to Dave, he said I was very privileged to be champion jockey for the 20th time and we kind of felt, for my own piece of mind, to do it like we did would help me come to terms with actually retiring,' he said. 'We also felt it might be a good thing for racing, people probably deserved to know. 'I thought it would die down but it never really did and those are things I'll remember for ever. When I looked around yesterday, as difficult as it was it helped me realise I'd made the right decision.' 'If I'd carried on and maybe not been as good as I was a lot of these people might not have come out. It's hard to say it but it is probably the right decision. 'I feel satisfied through what has happened with my life but I've also said I'd love another go because I feel I could still do it better than anybody! 'I never felt like I did a day's work in my life, I've felt a lot of satisfaction and fulfilment and I'm very proud of what I've been lucky enough to achieve but so many people have helped that happen, I was just the lucky one who got on the best horse most of the time. 'The owners, the trainers, the lads, the horses, I could go on all day thanking people. McCoy said he thought he could retire quietly but is glad he's had the chance to farewell racing properly . Sandown Park was packed out for the champion jockey's finale on Saturday in Esher . McCoy said there were 'a lot' of things he would miss about racing but also some aspects of the tough sport that he will be happy to see the back of. 'Like spending a lot of time in a hospital and ringing doctors begging for help to make me better,' he said. 'Obviously my wife Chanelle wanted me to retire but at the same time I knew myself it was the right time for my family, my mum and dad are in their 70s now and don't enjoy watching me as much any more because of the dangers involved so it certainly makes their life easier. 'I never thought of the dangers and when I got injured I felt I was unlucky and it wouldn't happen again but I know the dangers and they first became apparent to me when I was at Toby Balding's and Richard Davies died and just lately you only need to see what happened to John Thomas (McNamara) and Robbie McNamara.'","AP McCoy rode in his last races on Saturday at Sandown Park .

Not knowing when the car might burst into full flame, they scrambled to save her, while a police dash cam rolled. CNN obtained the footage from affiliate WPIX. Kinnelon Police Officers Mark Ehrenburg and Ricky Ferriola cut the seat belt from her, then dragged the woman's limp body away from the crash to start emergency medical care. Not a minute later, flames licked out of the car. Two more minutes -- an explosion. All three were lucky to escape the flames. The rescue started when someone reported an erratic driver on Thursday, and the officers sped off to investigate. When they pulled up at the scene, the 2006 Toyota Solara convertible was already a smoking wreck. Its horn was blaring. The officers ran over to the flipped over car, and shouted over the honking horn at the driver, ""Can you hear me?"" No response, not even a gesture, the video showed. It took them two minutes to cut off the seat belt, as smoke kept rising. Once they had her in safety, the officers hooked the driver up to a defibrillator and started CPR. The woman, identified by the Kinnelon Police Department as Dawn Milosky, 45, of Beachwood, New Jersey, was airlifted to Morristown Medical Center and survived. She's been charged with driving while intoxicated, having an open container of alcohol in the vehicle, reckless driving and with failure to stay in her lane, according to WPIX. Kinnelon Police Sgt. Chris Carbone told WPIX that they released the video to show that the driver may have died, if others had not informed the police. As for his colleagues' bravery, he said, ""A lot of times, we don't think of our own safety doing this job.""

5263cf68d7257a29a34facfc295ba162318c62ea,"Field Marshall Erwin Rommel sporting his famous goggles which were in fact a five from British Major General Michael Gambier-Parry . He was the one German leader in the Second World War who the British regarded with honour. Field Marshal Erwin Rommel gained respect from his foes for his tactical acumen and sense of fairness during the battle for North Africa. Rommel, nicknamed the Desert Fox, also became an iconic wartime figure – and the stylish goggles he famously wore across his peak cap became part of the myth. Now the story of how the German came to be in possession of the goggles can be told for the first time. They were given to him by a British prisoner as a gift to thank him for retrieving a stolen hat. Major General Michael Gambier-Parry, of the 2nd Armoured Division, was captured with 2,000 of his men by Rommel in Mechili, Libya, in 1941. The German field marshal invited the British officer to dine with him in a gesture of military camaraderie. The pair shared good wine and smoked ‘excellent cigars’, according to Gambier-Parry’s granddaughter, Liza Donoghue, 67. During the meal, Gambier-Parry complained that a German soldier had taken his hat. A furious Rommel then took it upon himself to get the garment back to his prisoner. And when Rommel later found Gambier-Parry’s Army goggles in a staff car, he asked the British officer if he could keep them and Gambier-Parry agreed. Scroll down for video .

'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi. Mr. Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit. But White House spokesman Josh Earnest later said the Iraqi leader did not make a specific request for additional military support during the meeting. President Barack Obama announced today $200 million in additional U.S. humanitarian aid to Iraq, but declined to say whether Washington would provide Apache helicopters, drones and other arms to Baghdad to help with the ongoing fight against ISIS . 'I think this is why we are having this meeting: to make sure that we are continually improving our coordination to make sure that Iraqi security forces are in a position to succeed in our common mission,' he told a reporter questioning him about military support following his Oval Office discussion with Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi, left . Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becoming prime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meant to convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has sought to be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq. The Obama administration, which welcomed Abadi's ascension after a tricky relationship with former Prime Minister Nurial-Maliki, may not agree to provide significant additional support. Obama, who was elected on the back of a promise to end the war in Iraq, is limited by public aversion to U.S. entanglement in another regional conflict and congressional constraints on his budget authority. In August, Obama authorized the first U.S. air strikes on Iraq since the 2011 withdrawal of American troops. He has also deployed about 3,000 American military forces to train and advise Iraqi and Kurdish forces to fight Islamic State. Abadi said after the meeting that Iraq would respect other countries' sovereignty and expected the same. He also said he was eager to bring all of the fighters in Iraq under state control. 'I am aware that regional countries have their own interests and I respect these interests, but I also welcome any assistance that they would provide, and I would like to thank them,' Abadi said through a translator. 'However, we do not accept any intervention in Iraq or any transgression on Iraqi sovereignty. This is a war that is fought with Iraqi blood with help from the coalition forces and regional countries.' The U.S. president in turn warned Iran that its fighters must respect Iraq's sovereignty and answer to the government in Baghdad in the battle against ISIS. Abadi is on his first trip to Washington since becomingprime minister last September. His meeting with Obama is meantto convey a U.S. stamp of approval for a leader who has soughtto be more inclusive than his predecessor in governing Iraq . Vice President Joe Biden, left,  and National Security Advisor Susan Rice also participated in the Oval Office discussion of the strategic partnership between the two countries, support in fighting ISIS as well as commercial and cultural relations . Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have played a major and growing role in battling the Sunni Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot also known as ISIL, that emerged from the chaos in Iraq and neighboring Syria and which swept through northern Iraq last June. Abadi has had to rely on Shi'ite militias, some of which are backed by Iran and advised by Iranian military officers, as Iraq's regular military deserted en masse last summer in the face of the Islamic State onslaught. Obama said he and Abadi discussed the issue at length in their Oval Office meeting on Tuesday. Asked about Iranian involvement in Iraq, Obama said that he expected the neighbors to have an 'important relationship,' and recognized that the mobilization of Shi'ite militias had been necessary to counter ISIL's advance last year. But he added that any foreign-backed groups in Iraq should now be under Abadi's control. 'Once Prime Minister Abadi took power ... from that point on, any foreign assistance that is helping to defeat ISIL has to go through the Iraqi government. That's how you respect Iraqi sovereignty,' Obama said. 'It needs to be help that is not simply coordinated with the Iraqi government, but ultimately is answerable to the Iraqi government and is funneled through the chain of command.'","Iraqi Prime Minister Haidar al-Abadi had been expected to seek billions of dollars in drones and other U.S. weapons during his visit to the Oval Office .

Sharon Edwards' car was left parked in her driveway and the clothes she had been wearing on March 14 were thrown in the washing basket in her bedroom. Her son, Eli Edwards, told Daily Mail Australia his family was struggling to come to terms with his mother's disappearance. Sharon Edwards, 55, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on Saturday March 14 in Grafton, NSW . Pictured from left: Her son Zac, husband John, son Eli, Ms Edwards and her third son Josh . ‘The worst part is not knowing anything, it’s such a mystery,’ he said. ‘My old man’s taking it pretty hard and I guess we are all just going through stages.’ There was no sign of forced entry at her Grafton home on the NSW north coast and it has left her family with many unanswered questions. Ms Edwards, a 55-year-old teacher, was last seen between 10pm and 11pm on March 14 after spending the afternoon with close friends at the nearby Good Intent Hotel. Her wallet and handbag are missing but she has not accessed any of her bank or social media accounts. She is not believed to have had any enemies, but as Ms Edwards has no history of mental illness police are treating the investigation as a homicide. The family made an emotional appeal for information last week as police said it was a homicide investigation . Sharon Edwards, 54, posted a smiling image of herself in front of a sunrise on the morning she disappeared . ‘We can’t think of anyone that would want to do anything to hurt her. We don’t have any theories,’ he said. Police and family say they hold 'grave concerns' for her welfare as it is extremely out of character. After police made it known they were investigating foul play, Mr Edwards said his family started to face the harsh reality that his mother may never be coming home. ‘It could be a real possibility and I guess after all this time it feels like there is really only one outcome left.’ Mr Edwards said regardless of how it happens, he wants his mum brought home. 'I want her to be found, one way or another.' 'We just need an outcome, at least that way we can all have some closure,’ he added. It was first noticed Ms Edwards was missing when she failed to show up for a class she was due to teach . She has no known medical conditions and has not made contact with relatives. Mr Edwards said he and his fiance sometimes worked weekends and his mother was due to come to Brisbane to help care for his young daughter. ‘She wouldn't miss that for the world,’ Mr Edwards explained.

As we know, the Premier League has the money and prestige, but what the FA Cup has is history, and boy does the BBC love a bit of history? Lest you were in any doubt, its coverage of the semi-final kicked off with footage of the late Sir Laurence Olivier doing the St Crispin's Day speech from the film of Henry V ('We happy few, We band of brothers,' and so on). Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer, Jason Roberts and Ian Wright fronted the BBC's coverage at Wembley . BBC presenter Lineker prepares to present the Match of the Day 50th anniversary special broadcast . Reading defender Nathaniel Chaloboah (left) chases Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey (right) on Saturday . Gunners forward Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring his side's winning goal in the FA Cup semi-final . Stand-in Match of the Day presenter Gabby Logan (left) with pundits Phil Neville and Robbie Savage (right) The excuse, I guess, was that Reading's nickname is the Royals, but as the second-tier team are also known as the Biscuitmen. The BBC even gave us a moment of history at half-time with a breakdown, something that used to be a regular feature of TV outside broadcasts, when a feature on Crystal Palace's shock semi-final victory over Liverpool 25 years ago came to a shuddering halt halfway through. In such instances, the BBC is lucky to retain the services of Gary Lineker, the best presenter of live football on TV. Sky have never really replaced the disgraced Richard Keys, who had the benefit of longevity in the post. The BBC needs to fight hard to avoid Lineker falling into the hands of rivals. Not that Sky's presenters are less than competent — David Jones did the job — but it's never a good sign when you have to go to Google to check which one it is. The price of live Premier League football is now way beyond the reach of the BBC, which may be the clincher in Lineker's future. While the BBC's match had the lion's share of the goalmouth action, it was difficult to resist turning over to Sky on occasion. Having invested its billions in the Premier League, Sky doesn't skimp on the peripheries. The sound always seems a little crisper, and in punditry, where Sky offers us the Rolls Royce of analysts, Gary Neville, the BBC counters with the mid-range Danny Murphy. In the commentary box, Sky fields Martin Tyler for its big games in the knowledge he'll rarely make a bad call, while the BBC never seems sure who its best commentator is. The man on the job on Saturday, Steve Wilson, is unfussy and made the most of what was the bigger story. The outcome on Sky was depressingly predictable. The BBC may miss out on the Premier League's pricey weekly thrills, but took the biscuit on Saturday. The BBC's Dan Walker talks pitchside with Sportsmail's Martin Keown at Wembley .

c9dbd58da54d6ab2795a9cf607358094126b8a41,"The Tennessee Supreme Court postponed execution dates for four inmates, effectively halting all executions while the courts decide whether current protocols for putting people to death are constitutional. Tennessee last executed a prisoner in 2009. Since then, legal challenges and problems obtaining lethal injection drugs have stalled new executions. In 2013 and 2014, the state tried to jump-start the process with a new one-drug lethal injection method and the reinstatement of the electric chair as a backup. The Tennessee Supreme Court has vacated the execution dates of the last four men on the state's death row as new lethal injection methods are challenged. Above, electrocution has been designated as a backup method . Beginning in December 2013, the court set new execution dates for 11 inmates. One inmate died in prison, and the execution dates for the others have been postponed as they approach because of legal challenges to the new methods. On Friday, the court postponed the last of the scheduled execution dates. It will set new dates after the legal questions are settled. States across the country have been struggling to find a method of execution that will stand up to legal challenges. And obtaining lethal injection drugs has been getting harder. As manufacturers have refused to sell drugs to prisons for executions, prison officials across the US have turned to compounding pharmacies, which make drugs specifically for individual clients. But those versions have also become difficult to come by because pharmacists are reluctant to expose themselves to possible harassment. Last month, the American Pharmacists Association adopted a policy discouraging its members from providing drugs for lethal injections, saying that runs contrary to the role of pharmacists as health care providers. Death row inmates challenging Tennessee's lethal injection method recently submitted an affidavit from University of Utah College of Pharmacy professor James H. Ruble that questions whether even a willing compounding pharmacist could provide the pentobarbital that Tennessee and several other states need for executions. Leroy Hall Jr, 48 (left) and Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53 (right) were both convicted of murder in 1991 and 1985, respectively. They no longer have dates for execution in Tennessee . Donald Strouth, 56 (left) and Abu-Ali Abdur'Rahman, 64 (right) were also both convicted of murder, though the European Union has called for Abdur'Rahman, who is believed to be mentally ill, to be allowed to live . Ruble says in the affidavit that the main ingredient for pentobarbital is unavailable from the six primary commercial sources that compounding pharmacists buy their ingredients from. The Tennessee Supreme Court's recent ruling will vacate the execution dates for Leroy Hall Jr, 48, Donald Wayne Strouth, 56, Nicholas Todd Sutton, 53, and Abu-Ali Abdur’Rahman, 64. Hall was convicted of premeditated murder and aggravated arson after burning his ex-girlfriend to death in 1991. Strouth was convicted of murdering a clothing store owner in 1978 by slitting his throat after he was knocked unconscious with a rock. Sutton was sentenced to death for stabbing a fellow inmate to death in 1985 after originally being sent to prison for child molestation. Abdur'Rahman, formerly James Lee Jones,  received his death penalty sentence for the murder of a Nashville cocaine dealer in 1986 while he was a remember of a militant Christian group looking to eliminate drugs from its neighborhood. The case of Abdur'Rahman, who was reportedly seriously abused by his parents as a child, has drawn international attention and the European Union called for a stay. He is believed to be mentally ill and had ineffective counsel during his trial, according to his website. There are 69 people on Tennessee's death row. The Tennessee Supreme Court (pictured) is waiting for verdicts about the constitutionality of the lethal injection drug pentobarbital . Tennessee last year reinstated electrocution as an alternative if lethal injection drugs are unavailable or a court rules the procedure unconstitutional. But that change has brought yet another legal challenge. Other states of the 31 with the death penalty are considering their own alternatives. Utah last month reinstated the firing squad as a backup method if it can't obtain lethal injection drugs. In Oklahoma, lawmakers approved nitrogen gas as a backup execution method. The state's Republican Governor Mary Fallin supports the death penalty but has not said whether she will sign the bill. Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf suspended his state's death penalty in February, citing the inefficiency of long court proceedings and expense. Ohio and Georgia are delaying all of their executions while investigation their lethal injection drug protocols. The US Supreme Court will hear a case later this month about the first substance in a so-called 'three drug cocktail', which is supposed to render the person being executed unconscious so they will not feel pain for the second two drugs. Scrutiny on the death penalty has increased since an execution using the drug, midazolam, resulted in an Oklahoma inmate writhing in presumed pain before dying 43 minutes after the procedure began. Tennessee uses only one drug in its protocol, the sedative pentobarbital. There are 69 people in death row in the state, according to the Department of Corrections. The Tennessee Supreme Court order said that their execution dates have previously been vacated for legal challenges.","Tennessee Supreme Court vacates execution dates for four men .

Since the majority-Hindu country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal, the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) member countries. Indian doctors at Kathmandu’s Bir Hospital told Mail Today that packets of ‘beef masala’ were sent by Pakistan on Tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors. These doctors – drawn from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) — are members of a 34-member medical team sent to Nepal for treating the survivors. “When we reached the airport to collect the food items from Pakistan, we found packets of ready-to-eat meals, including packets of ‘beef masala’. There were other food items too,” Dr Balwinder Singh told Mail Today. Perplexed, the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead. “We did not touch the Pakistani aid,” Dr Singh said. “Most of the local people are not aware of the contents. When they understand, they avoid it,” said another doctor on the condition of anonymity. He added: “Pakistan has hurt Nepal’s religious sentiments by supplying the masala. Shockingly, it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter.” Pakistani soldiers load relief supplies for Nepal . Exclusive photographs of the ‘beef masala’ packets supplied to Nepal are with Mail Today. These pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was Nowshera Cantt in Pakistan. These packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include ‘potato bhujia’ and ‘beef masala’. A top Nepal government official said: “The matter has been conveyed to Prime Minister Sushil Koirala and the intelligence chief. We are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts. If the report is correct, we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with Pakistan. India, being our key partner, will also be informed of the developments.” Tasneem Aslam, spokesperson for Pakistan’s ministry of foreign affairs, told Mail Today: “I am not aware of the issue…I am not responsible for the dispatch. The relief aid is sent by the National Disaster Management Authority.” Nepalese soldiers stand next to wrecked buildings at Durbar Square . A press note uploaded on the website of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Pakistan (http://www.ndma.gov.pk/new/), states: “(The) National Disaster Management Authority has dispatched the second of two sorties of C-130 aircrafts on April 28 in collaboration with Pakistan Army, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Pakistan Air Force. The relief goods include 250 tents, 200 food packs (2.6 tonne), 1,000 Meals Ready to Eat (MREs), 1,000 blankets and 33 cartons of medicines. These relief goods have been provided from NDMA stocks….” Despite repeated attempts, the officials of the Pakistan NDMA could not be contacted. The food items have been manufactured by PANA Force Foods. The consignment was supplied after receiving orders from Pakistan’s NDMA. “PANA Force food processing centre aims at providing quality goods at affordable prices. Currently, the company is supplying two brands of products to Pakistan Army commonly known as Meal Ready to Eat (MRE) and Emergency Pack Ration (EP Ration or high-energy biscuits) whereas a plant for the production of dehydrated vegetables and fruits is under construction,” the official website of PANA Force Foods mentions. The website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities, like earthquakes and floods. According to Hindu belief, eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one’s mother. In Nepal — for long the world’s only Hindu state — the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender. The first Civil Code of Nepal, the Muluki Ain of 1854, stated: “This kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows, women, and Brahmins may not be killed.” It trumpeted Nepal as the ‘purest Hindu kingdom’ and simultaneously signaled to Nepalese citizens that Hindu religious creeds would be the law of the land. But an amendment in 1990 to the Civil Code made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison. Delhi High Court raises alarm over illegal buildings . By Mail Today in New Delhi . Municipal authorities in Delhi received a rap from the Delhi High Court on Wednesday over the numerous illegal buildings across the city. Days after the killer earthquake in Nepal, the Delhi High Court on Wednesday said unauthorised constructions and colonies in the city are disasters waiting to happen. A bench of Justices Badar Durrez Ahmed and Sanjeev Sachdeva observed that if an earthquake hits Delhi like the one in Nepal, all the unauthorised buildings constructed without following regulations, will crumble. It also said each government has been extending the date till which illegal constructions are protected from punitive action as it is looking for votes. “If people die, then who will vote?” the court asked. “They are disasters waiting to happen. Are you (municipal corporations) taking strict action? Are you coming out with an action plan?” the bench questioned while hearing a batch of petitions on unauthorised constructions in the city. In response, the civic agency said it was coming out with an action plan. The court, thereafter, said it will take up the matter of seismic viability of structures in the national Capital in some other appropriate matter. UK aid team in security breach at Delhi airport . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . It has come to light that a rescue team which arrived from the United Kingdom on Monday for operations in earthquake-hit Nepal, violated the safety norms of the Delhi IGI Airport. The team allegedly waited in front of an aircraft at the ‘apron area’ of the airport for about six hours before they could fly to Kathmandu. According to the members of the British rescue team, after waiting for all those hours, they were accommodated in a flight of the Spanish Air Force. Members of the British rescue team headed to Nepal posted photos of themselves waiting at IGI Airport on Twitter . According to a senior civil aviation official, it was a case of gross violation of safety rules. The DGCA can take action against the agencies that were responsible for the violation. “DGCA had earlier punished various airlines for committing such a violation. This particular British team had dogs with them and they were in front of the aircraft for six hours. It’s scary,” a senior DGCA official said after seeing the photographs of the group that were posted by a rescue team member on Twitter. An immigration official said the British group comprised 15-20 personnel from the UK Fire and Rescue team. They reached Delhi IGI Airport around 5.30pm on Monday. But due to weather and other clearance issues, they were asked to wait at the airport. “The team didn’t have proper clearances. India keeps a watch on every unit and aircraft flying to Kathmandu through Delhi. Airport officials asked them to wait but instead of going to the terminal building, these rescue team members waited in front of the nosewheel of an aircraft,” a senior airport official told Mail Today. Later, when the Indian agencies told them that the weather in Kathmandu was not favourable and it was packed with aircraft, the British rescue team members arranged their materials on their own, the official said. After almost an hour they managed to convince the Spanish Air Force officials, who agreed to fly these British rescue team members to Kathmandu. “Even then, the rescue team members didn’t go inside the airport. No security official asked them to move from there. They remained there for more than three hours,” a senior immigration official said. “They had equipment which needed to be checked by various agencies. Also, they didn’t take proper permission due to which they were asked to wait. But, they ignored all security rules and stayed there in front of an aircraft,” a senior airport official said. According to a senior official of the ministry of civil aviation: “No one is allowed to wait in front of an aircraft. Even the passengers are not allowed to put their baggage near to the plane.” The team reportedly left Delhi around 12 midnight and reached Kathmandu around 2am.","Cows are treated as sacred in Nepal, where the majority are Hindus .

bc82c9e1be8d81ddf3ba0c30fb47f552088241c3,"When journalist Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's rapidly growing, yet unregulated, gestational surrogacy industry for HBO documentary series Vice, she didn't anticipate 'how dark' the story would get. For nearly two years, the producer and host has been reporting on current issues across the globe and has covered everything from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay to the effect of climate change on polar bears - but nothing could have prepared her for the moment when someone offered to sell her a baby over dinner while she was working undercover in India. 'It was the most heartbreaking experience that I ever had,' Gianna told Daily Mail Online. Baby business: Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni (pictured) traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry . Shady deal: The journalist from Brooklyn, New York, went undercover to meet with an agent in India who offered to get her a baby in two to three months . But the heartbreak did not end there. As Gianna quickly learned during her time working on the Outsourcing Embryos documentary, surrogacy in India is a multi-million dollar business, and one which is made all the more lucrative by the high number of American couples traveling to the country in order to use the services provided by one or more of the ‘embryo outsourcing’ agencies featured in the Vice documentary. During her time spent undercover posing as one of these people, Gianna was informed that, in order to maximize profits and ensure a final product, doctors are encouraged to implant multiple embryos in surrogates, which can lead to the surrogate having to abort one of the fetuses or give birth to multiple babies. And if an 'extra' baby is born, it isn't necessarily going home with its genetic parents. There are also issues with couples never making it to India to claim their children for whatever reasons, meaning that the newborn baby is left without a parent. For the most recent episode in the Vice series, Gianna went undercover to meet with one surrogacy agent who claimed over dinner that she could get her a Caucasian baby in two to three months - confirming that there were in fact ‘extra’ babies being sold on the black market. The agent then tried to convince Gianna and her team to buy the baby that they had brought with them to the restaurant. Shocking offer: One of the agents can be seen holding the baby that they brought to the restaurant with them . No morals: The agent eventually offered to sell Gianna and her team the baby over dinner . Gianna noted that the agent spoke with a 'shocking amount of ease' and 'talked about forging documents as if she has done it a hundred times' as she tried to sell her and her team a baby over dinner. 'It made me think it wasn't a one-off thing,' she explained to Daily Mail Online. Gianna never once considered buying the baby, but as a woman who would one day like to be a mother, she admitted that there was a moment when she thought about accepting the offer, knowing that she could provide the child with a loving home that it may never experience otherwise, particularly as it was made clear that the agent would have sold the baby to anybody. 'When I go on these stories, I am a human being first and a journalist second,' she said of her initial reaction to the offer. The sale of 'extra' babies on the black market was just one of the many shocking side effects of commercial surrogacy uncovered by Gianna and her team. In the US, surrogacy can cost hopeful parents upwards of $100,000, and Gianna explained that 'the reoccurring theme' when speaking with American agents and experts about couples hiring surrogates from other countries was money. Commercial surrogacy in India costs nearly one-sixth the amount it would in the Western World. 'That seems to be the main driver,' she explained, before noting that some prospective parents do choose foreign surrogacy because of the altruistic element. No options: Many of the surrogates who spoke with Gianna said that they decided to carry a baby because they desperately needed the money . Dormitory: The women who agree to be surrogates at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic have to live at the facility until they give birth . Tight quarters: Two surrogates can be see sitting on the beds in their shared room . And while American parents see the surrogacy business in India as being a ‘cheap’ alternative to the services offered at home, the amount of money made by a surrogate in India can vastly change her life, as well as the life of her family. Women can use the money to buy a home or send their own children to school, and Gianna explained that there are in fact couples who take great efforts to make sure their surrogates are a part of their lives. But there are also countless tales of financially desperate women who are recruited in the slums and coerced into signing contracts that they can't read, only to be duped out of the money they were promised. When I go on these stories I am a human being first and a journalist second . Surrogates undergo scheduled cesarean sections so doctors can ensure the greatest number of births per day. Gianna, who witnessed the high turnover rate first hand at Dr Nayna Patel's Akanksha Infertility Clinic, in the town of Gujarat, in the west of India, was nearly speechless when she saw how rapidly newborns and their parents were whisked away following a surrogate's C-section. Dr Patel maintained that the women are well taken care of and make more money than they could working 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in any other profession. And while Gianna explained that some women are happy that they can provide a house for their family and put their kids through school as a surrogate, the women she and her team spoke to said they chose to be surrogates because they didn't have any other options. During the episode, a surrogate named Vasanti told Gianna: 'Nobody likes doing this.' Dishonest: Although Dr Patel maintained that she didn't search for surrogates from the slums, Gianna met a woman who said she was working for the clinic owner as tried to recruit women from a poor area . No choice: A doctor can be seen performing a cesarean section on one of the surrogates. Surrogates have to undergo C-sections so doctors can maximize the amount of babies being born in a day . Too quick: Almost immediately after this baby was born via a surrogate, the biological parents whisked the newborn away in a van as they went to return to their home country . She continued: 'I didn't have a home, so I thought I could build one by being a surrogate.’ Another surrogate named Nisha explained that she was 'helpless' and had 'no alternatives'. Gianna was overcome by many of the surrogates' desperation. 'It is really hard to hear someone talk about going through an experience that takes a toll on the body, that lasts longer than nine months and takes them away from their kids because they have to support their families and essentially survive,' she said. Gianna recalled speaking with one surrogate's husband who recently lost his job and he confessed that he was grateful his wife had the opportunity to earn money for their family as a surrogate. He made clear that he didn't force her into the role, but explained that it was necessary for their family's survival. 'It all went back to money,' Gianna noted. As a whole, Gianna said that she thinks some parents may be aware of the 'shadier side' of commercialized surrogacy, but a 'vast majority’ have no idea this dark underbelly exits. Gianna recommends that parents who are considering foreign surrogacy options should do extensive research on the agent, the doctor and the surrogate they will be working with.","Vice correspondent Gianna Toboni traveled to India to explore the country's booming gestational surrogacy industry for the HBO series .

e03bd819c47d90a3bdaf707bb2a4905fd627cadb,"Letting the Scottish Nationalists dictate the direction of the UK government would be like getting King Herod to 'run a baby farm', Boris Johnson warned today in an escalation of Tory attacks on the SNP. The Tory London Mayor warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK, 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy'. He likened it to 'asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery'. Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson warned against allowing Nicola Sturgeon's SNP to dominate the government of the UK 'an entity that they are sworn to destroy' Ms Sturgeon launched her SNP manifesto today, boasting that she can 'lead the UK' with polices on British foreign policy, benefits, energy bills and English university tuition fees. The SNP leader vowed to use a surge in support for her party to dictate the direction of the UK government, calling for an end to austerity, rising benefits payments and the abolition of Trident as the price Ed Miliband would have to pay for propping up a weak Labour government. Ms Sturgeon set out a 'programme for delivery on a UK-wide basis', raising the prospect of Scottish nationalist MPs calling the shots on policies which apply only in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Polls suggest up to half of Scots are planning to vote SNP, handing the party dozens of seats and leaving Labour's Ed Miliband unable to secure a majority. The SNP has claimed that it will be 'entitled to vote against any bit of legislation' and 'any bit of spending' it does not agree with. Mr Johnson, who is expected to play a more high profile role in the Tory campaign from this week, issued a blunt warning about allowing an anti-Union party to dictate policy in Westminster. 'You wouldn't get Herod to run a baby farm, would you?,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'It would not normally occur to you to interview a convicted jewel thief for the post of custodian of the Tower of London. 'You would not dream of asking a fox to look after the henhouse or a temperance campaigner to run a brewery or Attila the Hun to work as a doorkeeper for the Roman senate. 'Any such course of action would be totally nuts. So can someone tell me why in the name of all that is holy there are some apparently rational people who are even contemplating the elevation of the Scottish Nationalist Party to a position of effective dominance in the government of the United Kingdom - an entity that they are sworn to destroy?' He said the SNP want to 'end Britain, to decapitate Britannia' but Mr Miliband has no chance of entering Number 10 without their support. Nicola Sturgeon today demanded an end to austerity as the price for propping up a Labour government in what was quickly dubbed a £140billion 'ransom note' for Britain . The SNP want higher taxes, to scrap Trident and end efforts to reform the welfare system, Mr Johnson warned. Mr Miliband will be left 'sitting in the driving seat, pretending to be steering the car - but all the time he will have clever Nicola next to him, whispering in his ear, and perpetually yanking the steering wheel to the Left'. Speaking at her manifesto launch, Ms Sturgeon said she had not 'heard the comments of Boris Johnson directly'. But speaking at the SNP manifesto launch, she said: 'If he did say that, then that is an entirely offensive comment, and I think it will be treated as that not just by people in Scotland but across the UK, who, in my experience, ordinary people the length and breadth of the UK do not see Scotland that way at all and do not see the SNP in that way at all.' However, the warning was echoed by David Cameron today, in a speech setting out the risks to England, Wales and Northern Ireland if the Scottish Nationalists are calling the shots. The Prime Minister yesterday suggested key services like roads and hospitals in the rest of the UK would suffer as a price of SNP support. ''This would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country. I think that is a frightening prospect,' he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show. 'People thinking in their own constituencies, is that bypass going to be built, will my hospital get the money it needs? Frankly this is a group of people that wouldn't care about what happened in the rest of the country. 'The rest of the United Kingdom – England, Wales, Northern Ireland, wouldn't get a look-in. 'That is the prospect we face if we don't get the majority Conservative government that is in our reach.'","London Mayor warns the SNP want to 'end Britain, to decapitate Britannia'

934a2d9235022c9e8a6aeec5e7e941b127569b76,"(CNN)The world's biggest and most powerful physics experiment is taking place as you read this. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile (27 km) ring. ""Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for,"" CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. ""Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC."" The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the ""Big Bang"" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics.  ""But we know that this model is not complete,"" Dr. Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the LHC, told CNN in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. ""After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape,"" said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology, Frédérick Bordry. ""But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels."" Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.","The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) begins again after a two-year shutdown .

In a photo album that spans over China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, extraordinary images portray the crop's full cycle from the primitive sowing of seeds to the distribution of millions of tonnes for consumption. The pictures were taken by professional photographer Scott Gable, 39, who spent four months travelling across the region documenting the labour and threadbare equipment used to harvest the carbohydrate-rich food. Scroll down for video . Majestic: A farmer wades through the mud with a stick as late morning rain falls on top of Dragonsbone terraces in Longsheng County, China . Rice is a staple food for more than one-half the world's population, but for many consumers, its origin remains somewhat of a mystery. The crop accounts for one fifth of all calories consumed by humans and 87 per cent of it is produced in Asia. It is also the thirstiest crop there is - according to the UN, farmers need at least 2,000 litres of water to make one kilogram of rice. Mr Gable said he was determined to capture every stage of production with his Rice Project - from the planting to the harvesting all the way down to the shipping of the food. After acquiring some contacts from experts at Cornell University in New York and conducting his own research, he left for China last May and spent the next four months traveling. He said: 'The images were taken over a four month period from April to July last year across Asia. I visited China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as part of my Rice Project.

'The industrialisation of our food and mono-culture food staples have interested me for some time so that's probably what inspired me to do this project. 'I shot the whole project using a Canon SLR and GoPros. The actual shooting took four months and then post production took another four more months.

'There are so many different languages in China. That was very difficult. There's no iPhone translation for these dialects.' Mr Gable is already working on a new related project documenting corn production and after that, he plans to do a similar investigation of wheat.

Tucked inside the stage adapter - the ring connecting Orion to the top propulsion stage of the SLS -will be 11 self-contained small satellites, each about the size of a large shoebox. Now, the space agency has revealed three missions that will use these small satellites during the test flight to help develop technologies for astronauts travelling to deep space. A concept image of the Near-Earth Asteroid Scout mission, one of 11 missions that will be secondary payloads to the first test flight of Nasa's Space Launch System . 'Nasa is taking advantage of a great opportunity to conduct more science beyond our primary focus of this mission,' said Jody Singer manager of Nasa's Flight Programs and Partnerships Office. 'While this new vehicle will enable missions beyond Earth orbit, we're taking steps to increase the scientific and exploration capability of SLS by accommodating small, CubeSat-class payloads.' The first is a Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit . Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout, using solar sail propulsion, will fly by a small asteroid, taking pictures and making observations. It aims to improve the current understanding of the asteroid environment and yield key information for future astronauts exploring an asteroid. Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. 'A solar sail works best when deployed in deep space and SLS will get us there,' said Les Johnson, principal investigator for NEA Scout at Marshall. 'It will take us out of Earth orbit and to interplanetary space - where we need to be to deploy the solar sail. It's a perfect ride to begin our mission.' Nasa's Lunar Flashlight will scout for locations on the lunar surface that are rich in resources that, once broken down into their component molecules, could be used in future exploration. The hope is future astronauts can use the technology to produce building materials, propellant, oxygen and water. Lunar Flashlight will use a large solar sail, similar to the NEA Scout sail, to reflect sunlight and illuminate the moon's permanently shadowed craters and then the science instruments will measure the surface water ice. Meanwhile, BioSentinel will use yeast to detect, measure, and compare the impact of deep space radiation on living organisms over long durations beyond Low-Earth Orbit. This will help scientists understand the effects of the deep space environment on biological systems as we plan to send humans farther into space than ever before. The BioSentinel mission will be the first time living organisms have travelled to deep space in over 40 years and the spacecraft will operate in the deep space radiation environment throughout its 18-month mission. The experiments will be launched by Houston-based Nasa in 2018 during a test flight of the Orion spacecraft using the largest, most powerful rocket booster ever built; the Space Launch System . The missions are a key part of the historic test flight, dubbed Exploration Mission-1. About 10 minutes after Orion and its service module escape the pull of Earth's gravity, the two will disconnect and Orion will proceed toward the moon. Once Orion is a safe distance away, the small payloads will begin to be deployed, all at various times during the flight depending on the particular missions. These CubeSats are small nano-satellites designed to be efficient and versatile. The masses of these secondary payloads are light - no heavier than 30lb (14kg). They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space. 'We are expanding the capabilities of this particular SLS test flight,' said Joseph Pelfrey, deputy manager of the Exploration and Space Transportation Development Office at Marshall. 'The rocket will be the strongest ever built by Nasa and we want to take advantage of that design. 'Flying secondary payloads is something we plan to do for missions to come and provide the science community an opportunity they haven't had before.' They will essentially piggyback on the SLS flight, providing what otherwise would be costly access to deep space.

Lorna McCarthy feared for her life in the hours leading up to her death at the hands of Barry McCarthy, the man she had spent 25 years with before their separation four months earlier. Mrs McCarthy, 50, sent a series of messages to friends and family on September 27, including one to her daughter saying she didn't know 'what he is capable of these days'. She urged her daughter to call the police if she did not hear from her the next day - but it was never received. Lorna McCarthy (left) was stabbed through the heart by her husband Barry McCarthy (right) last September . The couple, who were still sharing a home in Gorleston-on-Sea, Norfolk, but sleeping in separate bedrooms, had had an argument. McCarthy, 51, had previously found out his wife was using dating websites. But she had agreed to take her profile down after he confronted her, Norfolk Police said. But in the early hours of September 28, Mrs McCarthy revealed she did not want to try to save the relationship, Norwich Crown Court heard. A little later, he entered her bedroom and stabbed her 13 times, according to the Eastern Daily Press. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had died from a stab wound to the heart. McCarthy then handed himself into police, telling them he had killed his wife, the court heard. When officers went to their home, they found Mrs McCarthy - who her daughter described to the BBC as a 'very colourful' and 'well-known' - in the back bedroom. McCarthy will be sentenced on May 1, after being found guilty of murder at Norwich Crown Court . McCarthy pleaded not guilty to murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility. But a jury today found him guilty of murder following a eight-day trial. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Durham said: 'This was a horrific and brutal attack on a woman in her own home by a man she had spent 25 years of her life with. 'My thoughts go out to Lorna's family and friends, and I hope today's verdict will help bring them some comfort as they still try to come to terms with her tragic death.'

d57f761765222c8d2aa602c2110925e2c0f16437,"The belief that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, a leading professor of psychiatry has claimed. David Healy, head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatric unit in Bangor, North Wales, said the misconception that low levels of serotonin were responsible for depression had become established fact. He suggested that the success of so-called SSRI drugs – which include Prozac and Seroxat – was based on the ‘marketing of a myth’. Scroll down for video . The idea that the most popular antidepressant drugs raise serotonin levels in the brain is nothing more than a myth, psychiatrist Professor David Healy argues. Pictured is Prozac, one commonly prescribed  SSRI . The emergence of these serotonin reuptake inhibiting (SSRI) drugs in the late 1980s came after concerns about tranquilliser use to treat depression. Even though they were weaker than old-style tricyclic antidepressants, they took off because of the idea that SSRIs restored serotonin levels to normal, ‘a notion that later transmuted into the idea that they remedied a chemical imbalance’. In an editorial in the BMJ, Professor Healy said that in the 1990s, no one knew if SSRIs raised or lowered serotonin levels but there was no evidence that treatment corrected anything. He said: ‘For doctors it provided an easy short hand for communication with patients. ‘For patients, the idea of correcting an abnormality has a moral force that can be expected to overcome the scruples some might have had about taking a tranquilliser, especially when packaged in the appealing form that distress is not a weakness.’ However, other psychiatrists have refuted the professor’s claims, saying the profession has moved on from a simplistic description of the pills correcting a chemical imbalance. They warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’. Depression should be re-defined as an infectious disease rather than an emotional disorder, argues one scientist. The condition could result from a parasitic, bacterial or viral infection and future research into the condition should search for these micro-organisms, argues Dr. Turhan Canli, of Stony Brook University, U.S. If his theory is true, he hopes a vaccination to protect against depression could be developed in future. Writing in the journal Biology of Mood and Anxiety Disorders, Dr Canli said: 'It is time for an entirely different approach. 'Instead of conceptualising major depression as an emotional disorder, I suggest to re-conceptualise it as some form of an infectious disease. 'I propose that future research should conduct a concerted search for parasites, bacteria, or viruses that may play a causal role in the etiology of major depression.' Professor Sir Simon Wessely, President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘That antidepressants are helpful in depression, together with psychological treatments, is established. How they do this is not. ‘Most researchers have long since moved on from the old serotonin model. ‘Most important of all, SSRIs are safer if taken in overdose than the older tricyclics. ‘People should not change their current medication on the basis of this editorial alone.’ NHS Choices, the website which advises patients, says: ‘It would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms.’ Professor Healy’s editorial says it is important to raise questions about the drugs. He said: ‘In other areas of life the products we use, from computers to microwaves, improve year on year, but this is not the case for medicines, where this year’s treatments may achieve blockbuster sales despite being less effective and less safe than yesterday’s models. ‘The emerging sciences of the brain offer enormous scope to deploy any amount of neurobabble. 'We need to understand the language we use. Until then, so long, and thanks for all the serotonin’, he concludes. Professor David Taylor, Director of Pharmacy and Pathology and Head of Pharmaceutical Sciences Clinical Academic Group, King’s Health Partners, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Professor Healy makes a forceful but poorly supported argument against something which doesn’t and has never really existed: the idea that SSRIs ‘correct’ an ‘imbalance’ of serotonin in the brain. ‘Researchers and psychiatrists alike know that SSRIs are effective in a number of disorders but no one is sure exactly how they work. Their readily demonstrable effect is on serotonin but they have many indirect secondary effects in the brain. Other psychiatrists warned the controversy might harm depressed patients if they were deterred from taking the drugs, which had been proved to work in trials and the ‘real world’ ‘Prof Healy fails to mention that SSRIs supplanted earlier tricyclics largely because of their relative safety in overdose, not because of any conspiracy concerning a theory of serotonin’s involvement in depression.’ Dr Paul Keedwell, Consultant Psychiatrist and Specialist in Mood Disorders, said: ‘In the real world of the clinic, SSRIs are undeniably effective in treating individuals with major depression. 'They have become the first line treatment of choice because they have fewer troublesome side-effects than their predecessors, and are safer in overdose. ‘David Healy has previously claimed that SSRIs cause dependence or provoke suicide. ‘In so doing he has risked deterring individuals with severe depression from getting the help they need and this latest article just adds to this problem. ‘The risk of suicide from untreated depression is much greater than the risk of treating it with antidepressants, and yes, this includes SSRIs.’","David Healy is head of psychiatry at the Hergest psychiatry unit in Bangor .

11389d4d81ab5ac12b2f4fcbe67f6f7b69bdf37f,"George Osborne dodged questions over plans to offer more help to the country's top earners . Labour and Tory politicians have come to blows over the 45p top tax rate following the Chancellor's admission that establishing the threshold was not one of the Government's priorities. George Osborne has avoided calls to rule out further help for the country's top earners, offering vague answers when asked whether those raking in more than £50,000 could see the rate lowered. Instead he says the Conservatives are committed to raising the tax-free personal allowance bracket from £10,000 to £12,500. Raising 40 per cent tax so that it only applies to those earning at least £50,000 was also a priority, he said. At present anyone earning between £31,866 to £150,000 is taxed at the higher rate. Those earning above £150,000 are taxed at the higher rate of 45 per cent. But Labour politicians are calling for the amount to be raised to 50 per cent for those in the highest bracket. Accusing the current Government of prioritising 'helping the very richest', Shadow chief secretary Chris Leslie condemned the Chancellor's refusal to rule out offering reduced tax rates on high income salaries. When pressed in an interview with Sky News the Chancellor refused to rule out making further cuts for Britain's top earners, instead saying the issue was 'not a priority'. 'If that was our priority or our plan we would have made it part of our plan and made it one of our priorities. Scroll down for video . 'That's not our plan. Judge us by what we want to do and what we want to do is increase the tax-free personal allowance to £12,500 so people full-time on the minimum wage don't have to pay income tax and millions are better off,' he said. 'And when it comes to higher rate taxpayers our priority is increasing the threshold at which you pay that higher rate, the 40p rate, to £50,000.' 'Those are our big tax commitments for the coming parliament.' The Chancellor added that any deal between Labour and SNP would harm the country, claiming the latter's leader, Nicola Sturgeon, was 'much stronger' than the opposition leader . He also refused to commit to devoting 2 per cent of the budget to defence, the limit agreed by NATO members. David Cameron has faced repeated calls to commit to spending 2 per cent of the budget on defence . 'We made a commitment at Nato. We are spending it today. We have made a clear commitment to the future of the equipment budget, to increase that in real terms ..,. and we have made commitments on the size of the armed forces,' he said. 'I don't think anyone should be in any doubt ... about our commitment to strong national security'. He also said any deal struck between the SNP and Labour would harm the country, lambasting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to broker such a partnership as 'disturbing'. 'The fact that the Labour Party, that was a party that campaigned for the Union in the referendum, is contemplating an arrangement with the SNP, who want to break up the country, is deeply disturbing.' He added the Scottish nationalist leaders were 'much stronger' than the opposition leader who he said would be overrun if they entered a coalition together. 'That would be bad for the entire United Kingdom, bad for the integrity of the Union but also bad for our economy because it would mean higher debts and higher taxes.' He also accused Ed Balls of 'running scared' by not agreeing to a debate with him and Danny Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

The 36-year-old is gearing up for his $300million welterweight showdown with Floyd Mayweather on May 2 - in what is set to become the richest bout in boxing history. But the Philipine star took time out of his preparation to thank American film director Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for their support so far. Manny Pacquiao took to Instagram to thank Spike Lee and Tito Mikey ahead of his bout vs Floyd Mayweather . The 36-year-old also posted a photo thanking NBA legend Karl Malone (centre left) for visiting him at the gym . 'Hello to all my fans in New York and thank you to Spike Lee and Tito Mikey for supporting Team Pacquiao,' Pacquaio said via Instagram on Thursday. 'I hope to see you soon. God bless.' The duo are just the latest to show their support for the 'Pac-man' ahead of his fight against Mayweather at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas next month. Former two-time NBA MVP and 14-time All-Star Karl Malone is another who appears to be behind the camp of the southpaw boxer. Later on Thursday, Pacquaio took to Instagram again to post a picture with the 51-year-old at his Wild Card gym base in Los Angeles. Pacquiao's trainer, Freddie Roach, believes his man is ready to beat Mayweather in Las Vegas on May 2 . Accompanied with the caption: 'Thank you Karl Malone for visiting me today. God Bless you and your family,' the pair are all smiles alongside trainer Freddie Roach. And speaking earlier in the week, Roach believes that his fighter has a better chance of beating Mayweather now than he did in 2010. Asked whether the 2010 or 2015 version of Pacquiao would have a better chance of victory against the unbeaten Mayweather, Roach told boxingscene.com : 'That is an interesting question because there are obviously trade-offs between the two versions of Manny. But I am convinced that the 2015 model is the more formidable fighter for a few reasons. 'Back in 2010, Manny was still growing into a welterweight. His first two welterweight fights were against Oscar De La Hoya in 2008 and Miguel Cotto in 2009 where he only weighed 142 and 144 pounds respectively, and in between he dropped down to 138 to fight Ricky Hatton. 'Floyd has been campaining as a welterweight since 2005 and weighed 150 in his fight against De La Hoya so that might have given Floyd an advantage. I still like Manny's chances in that fight but I think the Manny of today has a lot more in his favour. Pacquiao is better equipped to beat Mayweather now than he was in 2010, according to his trainer Roach . Mayweather is looking to extend his 47-fight unbeaten streak when he meets Pacquiao next month . 'In 2010 the two-year age difference between the fighters was not significant to either, but that's not true today. Floyd at 38 is doing things he didn't do in the past. Floyd is a defensive genius but he has always depended on his legs to perform and you can see now that his legs do not have the same spring or fluidness of his earlier years. Mayweather remains the bookmakers' favourite for the $300million mega-fight next month but Roach is adamant that Pacquiao is primed to cause an upset. 'The 2015 version of Manny is more mature, smarter and less reckless than the 2010 version,' said Roach. 'He will be treating the ring like a chess board anticipating Floyd's moves - ready to cut him off and attack every time he creates an opening. 'I have all the confidence in the world that Manny is going to knock Floyd out on May 2.'

But while they have been able to put a date on when life appeared, they are still far from knowing how it appeared. Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago. Scroll down for video . Scientists believe life on Earth began evolving around 3.8 billion years ago, but they are still far from knowing how it appeared.  Now researchers in the US and Italy say they have evidence that DNA-like fragments may have come with 'instructions' that guided their growth into complex life forms 4 billion years ago . RNA, which stands for ribonucleic acid, is a molecule made up of one or more nucleotides. It is one of three major biological molecules that are essential for all known forms of life, along with DNA and proteins. The main job of RNA is to transfer the genetic code to create proteins from the nucleus to the ribosome. This prevents the DNA from having to leave the nucleus, and protects it from damage. It also acts as an on-and-off switch for some genes. The researchers believe these fragments used their innate self-evolving abilities to grow into repeated chemical chains long enough to evolve into primitive life. The study, by the University of Milan and University of Colorado Boulder, is based on a discovery in the 1980s that RNA can chemically alter its own structure. RNA is similar to DNA, and carries out a number of jobs in our cells, including acting as an on-and-off switch for some genes. Scientists believe that when life was in its early stages, RNA played a leading role in creating complex organisms before DNA and proteins were developed. Many origin-of-life researchers say that RNA chains are too specialised to have been created as a product of random chemical reactions. The new study, however, claims to provide an alternative theory by arguing primordial DNA-like fragments evolved in this way instead. The researchers found the self-assembly of DNA fragments just a few nanometres in length have the ability to drive the formation of chemical bonds. These connect together short DNA chains to form long ones, without the need for a separate biological process. The image shows a droplet of condensed nano-DNA and within it smaller drops of its liquid crystal phase which show up in polarised light on the left. The liquid crystal droplets act as 'micro-reactors' where short DNA can join together into long polymer chains to evolve into more complex life . 'Our observations are suggestive of what may have happened on the early Earth when the first DNA-like molecular fragments appeared,' said CU-Boulder physics Professor Noel Clark, a study co-author. The study suggests that the way in which DNA emerged in the early Earth lies in its structural properties and its ability to self-organise. In the pre-RNA world, the spontaneous self-assembly of fragments of nucleic acids – the building block of life - may have acted as a template for their chemical self-assembly. 'The new findings show that in the presence of appropriate chemical conditions, the spontaneous self-assembly of small DNA fragments into stacks of short duplexes greatly favours their binding into longer polymers, thereby providing a pre-RNA route to the RNA world,' added Professor Clark.","Scientists say early DNA-like fragments guided their own growth .

A beachfront property with spectacular views has gone on the market for £3million, and it is already drawing interest from viewers who are enamoured with the series’ stunning setting – and actor Aidan Turner’s chiselled looks. Since the series started airing last month estate agents said they have seen a rise in enquiries about the cottage, overlooking an ancient smugglers’ cove on Cornwall’s north coast, and other properties where the title character, Ross Poldark, plies his trade. Scroll down for video . A beachfront property with summer and winter cottages (middle, bottom left) has gone on the market for £3million in Cornwall . The property has stunning views of Smugglers Cove, and the summer and winter cottages are linked via a lift (pictured: summer cottage) Poldark actor Aidan Turner has become a heartthrob for fans after his character took off his shirt on the popular BBC One show . Ben Standen, from estate agents Jackson-Stops & Staff of Truro, said Smugglers Cottage in Smugglers Cove, near Portreath, has a summer and winter cottage, cleverly linked via a lift. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the property has direct access to the beach and an amazing view of uninterrupted coast and open sea. The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, and they can be used separately to provide lots of space for a family. Mr Standen said: ‘The fact it has direct access onto the beach and has these two houses linked by a lift - it's the sort of thing that comes on the market once every 20 or 30 years.’ The scenic county has always been a popular destination thanks to its rugged coastline, but interest in the programme, based on Winston Graham’s Poldark historical novels, set in the 18th century, is giving the local tourism and housing market a boost. Boasting seven bedrooms, six reception rooms and seven bathrooms, the stunning property has direct access to the beach . One of the larger bedrooms in the summer cottage offers amazing views of Smugglers Cove on the northern coast of Cornwall . The summer cottage has three bedrooms and the winter cottage has four, with uninterrupted views of the sea . Smugglers Cottage is located just a few miles from some of the series’ filming locations, including nearby St Agnes Head, which doubles as Nampara Valley, part of the Poldark family estate, in the show. There are lots of 'Poldark experiences' now on offer in the county – with kayak, horseback and walking Poldark tours. Mr Standen added: ‘I certainly think the Poldark series has heightened Cornwall's appeal. There are lots of 'Poldark experiences' now on offer in the county – with kayak, horseback and walking Poldark tours . Smugglers Cottage is located just a few miles from some of the series’ filming locations, including nearby St Agnes Head . The show’s popularity is coupled with the county’s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination . ‘There are more people coming down here more regularly and expressing interest in buying a second home. ‘Properties on the coastline with these breathtaking views have got a lot of appeal and are incredibly popular, which the series has made people more aware of.’ The show’s popularity is coupled with the county’s stunning scenery and history in making Cornwall a desirable destination. Estate agents said they have seen an increase in interest in holiday homes in Cornwall since Poldark began airing last month . Smuggling was rife in the 18th century, when Poldark is set, and Cornwall's coast is full of hidden coves and tucked-away inlets. It was popular with smugglers because it had a long expanse of rocky, virtually uninhabited coast. With few revenue men to patrol it, goods like tea, brandy, rum and tobacco were smuggled in. All four of Fowey's public toilets are out of service just weeks before summer . Poldark fans and thousands of other holidaymakers who are planning to visit a popular seaside town in Cornwall may have nowhere to go when nature calls. Located in the heart of Poldark country, the town of Fowey is locked in a bizarre and long-running wrangle over public toilets. All four of the main public conveniences in Fowey – where a Poldark exhibition is being planned in May – are closed and with the summer tourist season fast approaching, there’s no sign of the wee wrangle being resolved. The town council agreed to take over the running of the four public toilets from Cornwall Council at the start of 2013. But more than two years later, the details of the transfer of ownership of three of them - Caffa Mill, the main car park and Readymoney Cove – are still being worked out by the county council while the fourth block, at the Town Quay, is shut for refurbishment. Town clerk Sally Vincent said: ‘There is nothing more the town council can do to push it on... it is still in the legal loop. ‘I am hopeful it will be completed soon. ‘The town council is really pleased to be able to take on the ownership of the toilets. ‘As a town council we feel we need to get the Town Quay toilets up and running and then go from there. It's important that Fowey has these facilities.’ The Town Quay toilets were already owned by the town council but leased to Cornwall Council, which has meant the handover could be completed more quickly. Refurbishment work started last week and it is hoped they will be open within eight weeks, with the toilet for the disabled being available to use while work is done on the others. When they reopen, visitors will have to pay 20p per use to offset the cost to the town council of running them. Mrs Vincent added: ‘The cost of running toilets is astronomical. ‘The town council simply doesn't have the money to do it for nothing so it was felt that if we charge 20p it would be something towards it.’ Cornwall Council figures suggest it will cost a minimum of £26,000 a year to run the four sets of toilets, with the town having to cover insurance costs and business rates as well as cleaning, maintenance and consumables. Until the transfer of ownership on the three blocks at the main car park, Readymoney Cove and Caffa Mill, is completed, the responsibility for opening the toilets will rest with Cornwall Council.","Interest in the hit BBC series Poldark has given Cornwall's tourism and housing market a boost .

The donor, who is known to church officials but has asked not to be named, sent the money along with a note, saying they wanted to help safeguard the church 'for the next hundred years'. The cash will be put towards the Abbey's restoration fund, which is aiming to raise £20million to repair the collapsing floor, fit heating powered by the Bath springs, and expand the building. A mysterious benefactor posted the plain brown envelope to officials at Bath Abbey, pledging £1.5million to the church's £20million restoration fund . Laura Brown, who is heading up the Footprint restoration project, said she had to read the letter twice before she could believe it was real, adding that she had to have a 'sit down' afterwards . The donation was accompanied by a note, which reads: 'Much impressed by the care and the consultation with has been put in by the Abbey, which is such a vital part of Bath’s future. 'This generation has a solemn duty to ensure the Abbey is fit and able to carry out its service to the city and the community for the next hundred years.' The church has been granted £10.4million of Heritage Lottery Funding, but only provided they can raise the additional £7.1million themselves by the end of the year. Before the mysterious benefactor came forward, the largest single donation the church had received was £1.1million from the congregation and charity Friends of Bath Abbey. The Footprint project was granted £10.4million of Heritage Lottery funding to repair the floor, and expand the building, but only if the church can raise the remaining £7.1million by the end of the year . The church congregation, and charity Friends of Batch Abbey, donated £1.1million to the project, but the anonymous donor topped that, with their gift of £1.5million . Laura Brown, 48, who is heading up the Footprint project, told MailOnline: 'We received it in the post, just like any normal letter, and it was in a plain brown envelope just like any normal letter. 'Your first thought is ""no, hang on, that can't be right"" but then you read it again and realise, this is actually happening. I had to have a sit down for a while. 'Of course there is gratitude, but there's also this glow you get. The team believe in this project so much and it feels so good to see that someone else sees the same thing. 'Not only that but that person has the resources to be able to really make something happen, and hopefully inspire other people as well.' She added that the church still needs to raise £4.1million in the next eight months, but that cash donations have already started arriving, and more people are also pledging money. Part of the Bath Abbey rennovations will see it fitted with an eco-friendly underfloor heating system which uses water from the River Avon, warmed by the town's springs . Speaking after the first £1.1million was donated, Reverend Prebendary Edward Mason, said: 'It’s wonderful, what a remarkable group of people. 'Less than six months ago, the Abbey invited its members to consider the Footprint project by pledging gifts. 'In this short space of time, the total raised has risen to £1.1 million, an amazing response. 'Footprint is about sustaining a Christian presence at the Abbey in the heart of Bath for the next century and these gifts demonstrate the congregation and The Friends of Bath Abbey’s commitment to the project.'","Anonymous benefactor donated money to £20million restoration fund .

6559748e1c5dac470776d1ffc842973830d81da7,"Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme. They're accused of reaping more than $31 million in a Ponzi scheme that promised high returns to investors from funding loans to cash-strapped pro athletes. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced the charges Monday against William D. Allen, Susan Daub and their Capital Financial Partners investment firms. Allen, 36, was a cornerback in the NFL from 2001 to 2012, playing for the New York Giants and the Miami Dolphins. Accused: Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators over allegations the pair ran a multi-million dollar Ponzi scheme (file photo) He was signed by the New England Patriots in March 2012 but was placed on injured reserve the following August, and he left football in March 2013. Daub, 54, is a financial professional who also lives in Florida, according to the SEC. The SEC said Allen and Daub paid about $20 million to investors but received only around $13 million in loan repayments from athletes. To make up the gap they paid investors with other investors' money rather than actual profits on the investments, in a classic Ponzi scheme, the agency said. The SEC said Allen and Daub misled investors about the terms and even the existence of some of the loans, telling them they could receive interest on the loans of up to 18 percent from the athletes. The pair used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures, the agency alleged. The SEC's criminal complaint quoted the website for Capital Financial as saying 'In many cases, athletes' contracts do not allow them to access their guaranteed money during the off season or early in the season when they may need a significant sum to purchase a house or car, pay the bills, or meet a financial demand. 'By pooling the resources of a network of investors, CFP gives athletes access to money when they need it while providing investors with solid, short-term returns on investment.' The SEC said its lawsuit against Allen and Daub was filed under seal in federal court in Boston last week and unsealed on Sunday. The agency won an asset freeze against them from the court last week. Two of their firms are based in Boston. Scam: The SEC alleges that Allen and his business partner Susan Daub used some funds from investors to cover personal charges at casinos and nightclubs and to finance other business ventures (file photo) The SEC is seeking an injunction against Allen and Daub and the firms, as well as unspecified penalties and restitution of allegedly ill-gotten gains. Paul Levenson, director of the SEC's regional office in Boston, said in a statement: 'The defendants sold investors on the idea of lending money to pro athletes, but we allege that’s not where a large portion of the investors’ money went. 'As in any Ponzi scheme, the appearance of a successful investment was only an illusion sustained by lies.' The telephone wasn't answered at a listing for Will D. Allen in Davie, Fla., where Allen is said to live. A person answering the phone at Daub's home said there was no comment. They are not represented in the case by attorneys, according to the SEC.","Former NFL cornerback Will Allen and his business partner Susan Daub are facing civil fraud charges from federal regulators .

Images of Sarkozy arriving at a specialist financial court in Paris today are a huge embarrassment for a politician who still thinks he can return to power. Slinking back into public view: Nicolas Sarkozy is driven to court where he faces charges over the funding of his failed 2012 bid to retain the presidency of the country - two days after being heralded as France's saviour . Thierry Herzog, the lawyer of the former French President and current head of the right-wing UMP opposition party, arrives at the Pole Financier headquarters (the fraud section of the courthouse) in Paris . Not only was he roundly beaten by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, but he is alleged to have got the UMP party to pay off his personal fine approaching £500,000 for over-spending. Under French electoral law, Sarkozy should have paid the fine himself from his own funds. On Sunday, his party made massive electoral gains against the Socialists in regional elections, and Sarkozy is convinced he can become president again in 2017. After the UMP won 66 out of 101 departments - the French equivalent of counties - Sarkozy announced: 'The French have massively rejected the policies of Francois Hollande and his government.

Within days of leaving the Elysee Palace in 2012, the Paris home he shares with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni, was raided by police. He is facing criminal charges in numerous cases, including an investigation into more than £15million of false billing by Bygmalion, an events-organising company, during the 2012 campaign. It has also been alleged that Sarkozy's successful 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of pounds worth of illegal cash from Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the late Libyan dictator.

The Filipino has been involved in some of the biggest bouts in the world over the past decade or so, facing the likes of Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto and four fights against Mexican warrior Juan Manuel Marquez. But it's been a tough road to the top for Pacquiao from being born into poverty in the Philippines.

Ever since dethroning the South African world champion on that June night at the MGM Grand 14 years ago, Pacquiao hasn't looked back and is set to take on Mayweather in the Fight of the Century on Saturday. Just days away from the $300million showdown on the Vegas Strip, pictures have emerged of Pacquiao as a teenager in a Manila boxing gym, when occasions such as this Saturday night were just a dream. Pacquiao moved away from home a the age of 14 to the country's capital Manila to pursue his boxing career and the rest, as they say, is history. The 36-year-old is now one of the biggest stars in the world. These incredible pictures show Pacquiao training at the LM Gym in Manila in 1996 at the age of 17 after he won his first 10 professional bouts - all of which were in 1995. In the same year that these pictures were taken, Mayweather was preparing to box at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, which ended for him in a controversial loss  against Serafim Todorov in the semi-finals. Nineteen years later, Mayweather and Pacquiao will finally cross paths in the biggest fight of this generation. The pair will make their first public appearances of the week on Tuesday as the bout draws ever closer. Boxing fans have already begun pouring into Las Vegas to taste the atmosphere building around the richest fight in history, even though only 500 tickets for the clash were made available for general sale. Pacquiao will host a fans' rally on Tuesday at the Mandalay Bay Hotel with trainer Freddie Roach, promoter Bob Arum and his pet Jack Russell Pacman also present. Attention then turns to the MGM Grand, the venue for the fight on Saturday and where Mayweather will be making his grand arrival. The welterweight rivals were both due to attend the traditional grand arrival that marks the beginning of fight week only for Arum to withdraw Pacquiao, claiming the event is a 'waste of time'. Arum also pulled the plug on a media conference call with Pacquiao last week before a question had been asked, while Mayweather spoke for almost half an hour the following night. The one upmanship is sure to continue until fight day. Pacquiao has been involved in some of the biggest fights over the last decade but Saturday's occasion will eclipse all of them .

Nothing was stolen but Woolaston, from Erdington, Birmingham, left behind the bag containing the charge sheet. Police were then able to pin four other burglaries on him with the help of students who  positively identified him. After the case, Detective Constable Jon Green, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Woolaston targeted students at Birmingham University in order to feed his drug habit. However, Woolaston was caught after breaking into the University's bio-sciences lab and leaving behind a bag containing a previous police charge sheet, with his name and address written on it . 'He wore a University of Birmingham top and pretended to be a maintenance engineer in order to enter the student flats and steal electrical goods. 'Unfortunately for him, Woolaston managed to leave vital evidence behind at one of the break-ins, and we are grateful to vigilant students who were able to identify him for further burglaries. 'Woolaston was charged with a total of five offences, and asked for a further five burglaries to be taken into consideration. We are happy with his sentence.'","Ricky Woolaston, 35, posed as engineer to break into students' homes .

c8624a481fb71e13fa00b3b03ba0dc91db1c5dec,"This is the spectacular moment a goose narrowly avoids a snapping fox’s jaw after the sly animal had given an almighty leap in a bid to take down the large bird. However despite the fox’s best efforts to capture the Canadian goose - it only came away with a single feather. The action-packed photographs were captured by Roger Byng, 67, on the Wetlands surrounding the Severn estuary in Slimbridge, Gloucester. Lunch! The hungry fox races across the grass towards the large Canada goose... Launch! He is poised to take off as his startled prey takes flight ... Mr Byng, from Bristol, was in a hide ‘with the intention of photographing small British birds, such as Bullfinches, Long-tailed Tits and Wrens as part of a relaxing day’s photography.’ However Mr Byng’s relaxing day’s photography came to an explosive end after he noticed a charging fox out of the corner of his eye. ‘I suddenly saw it break into a run towards the geese so I quickly moved my camera and lens to focus on the fox,’ explained the married Grandfather-of-nine. ‘I had no time to change any settings on my camera but managed to capture the action as he tried to take down the goose.’ Gotcha! The fox leaps but his jaws snap shut a fraction too late to bring down the bird . Escape: The goose manages to take flight leaving the hungry fox in its wake . The retired security installer described how the fox came so close to what surely would be a grand catch for an animal that is roughly the same size as its prey. ‘The fox was on a search for food, evidently being hungry enough to tackle a large goose. ‘It broke into a run in an effort to take one of the geese, who at the last moment caught sight of his approach. ‘Whilst one of the geese clears the grass and rises into the air quite quickly, the other one was slower to rise enabling the fox to get close. Spitting feathers! The unsuccessful fox drops back down to earth . ‘It jumped into the air to make a grab, with jaws open and teeth displayed. It is the good fortune of the goose that he gained just sufficient height that the fox was only able to get a bite on his tail feathers. ‘The fox came away with a single feather, whilst the goose escaped with a squawk!’ The wetlands that the pictures were taken on are managed by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust and can be accessed by paying a small fee or by taking out an annual membership granting you entry to all of the sites in the UK. Mr Byng adds: ‘Slimbridge is a wonderful location for witnessing the activity of a large number of birds and wildlife, including migratory species such as Bewick Swans.’","Photos capture spectacular moment goose narrowly avoids fox's jaw .

Facebook has launched a new app called Hello designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers. Scroll down for video . Facebook has launched a new app called Hello (pictured) designed to give you more control over who can call you and how their details appear - even if their number isn't stored in your contacts book. It pulls in any publicly-shared data from a user's Facebook profile and lets you easily block unwanted callers . The free app is currently in testing and is only available on Android devices in the US. It is expected to roll out to other regions and devices if testing is successful. 'Billions of calls are made everyday on mobile phones and people often have very little information about who’s calling them,' explained Facebook's product manager Andrea Vaccari in a blog post. Facebook has tweaked its News Feed setting to make posts from friends more prominent. The rules about seeing multiple posts from the same person in a row have been relaxed to show more from friends. Content posted directly by friends who people interact with more or have a direct relationship with will now appear higher up  in News Feed so they are less likely to miss it. The latest update will also make posts and Pages that friends have liked and commented on appear lower down. Facebook said: 'The goal of News Feed is to show you the content that matters to you. 'This means we need to give you the right mix of updates from friends and businesses. 'This balance is different for everyone [and] as more people and pages are sharing more content, we need to keep improving News Feed to get this balance right.' 'Today we are starting to test Hello, a new app built by the Messenger team. 'Hello connects with Facebook so you can see who’s calling, block unwanted calls and search for people and places.' When a user receives a call, Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved. Users will only see information that people have already shared on Facebook, and not everyone links their mobile number to their account so this could be the app's downfall. Callers must also have a Facebook account in order for the data to be shared but they don't necessarily have to be logged in at the time of the call. They also don't need to have Hello installed, either. Another feature of Hello includes making it easier to block unwanted calls. From the settings menu in Hello people can block specific numbers and adjust whether they want to automatically block calls from commonly blocked numbers. This is useful for blocking company phone numbers or spam callers, for example, and blocked calls go straight to voicemail. When a user receives a call Hello shows them info about who’s calling, even if they don’t have that number saved (pictured left). Hello also makes it easier to block unwanted calls and see which numbers have been blocked from other users (pictured right) in the app's settings menu . The list of blocked calls can also be reviewed in the recent calls list. If a call is made and the number isn't linked to a Facebook account,  Hello simply shows the number like a traditional caller ID. However, if other users have blocked this number the number of times it has been blocked is also shown. Elsewhere, when users search for people and businesses on Facebook they can call them with  one tap when Hello is installed. And in the case of searching for businesses, Hello will also show opening hours and web addresses where possible, on the user's screen.","When a user receives a call, Hello will show them info about who’s calling .

47b2ad590d29f766eb0f6e114ababb53e4e7cf50,"(CNN)The night before her daughter's first triathlon, Kate Parker could tell the child was nervous. Ella and her younger sister, Alice, are athletic, loud, curious, wild-haired kids. They grew up watching their mother compete in races and Ella had asked to sign up for her own. Still, as they laid out everything she'd need the next day, Parker, a photographer, could tell she was afraid. ""Why don't we get a picture?"" Parker asked Ella, now 9. ""Show me your strongest face, show me your bravest face, even if you don't feel that way right now."" As she pulled the image up on her screen, she got chills from her daughter's direct stare. She looked, Parker said, like ""a little badass."" ""You're going to be totally fine,"" Parker showed her. ""Look at how tough you are."" The next day, Ella participated in her race, and loved it. Looking back, ""I wanted her to remember that she was scared and she went through with it, sort of as a memento of her conquering a fear, "" said Parker, who lives near Atlanta. ""As a mom, I really wanted to get a good picture of it, too."" The photo is one of Parker's favorites from her series, ""Strong is the New Pretty."" It covers the last two years, but evolved from Parker's early days behind a camera, when she shot daily images of her girls to expand her knowledge of lighting and composition. It seemed that most images of little girls showcased perfectly placed hair bows, forced smiles and Photoshop-smooth skin. Hers didn't. ""I didn't want to shoot pictures like that. I didn't want girls to think they had to look like that,"" said Parker, whose daughters are now 6 and 9. ""Whoever they were, however they were, was worthy of an image. Whatever they were was good enough."" So, she shot her girls and their friends as they were -- freckled, muddy, screaming, laughing, jumping in the pool, collecting worms in the creek, barreling into the wilderness of early adolescence on skateboards and bicycles. ""I want to capture them before they lose that sense of 'I'm so awesome.' I wanted them to keep that as long as they could,"" Parker said. ""I started to shoot with that in mind, but it was already there."" The girls pose for an occasional portrait, but most are kid-inspired moments, shaped by childish wonderment and energy. As parents, Parker and her husband encourage their girls to play outside, make new friends and try new things without worrying about grass-stained knees and knots in their hair, Parker said. Now, the girls have the confidence and curiosity to do it on their own. ""They're just being themselves, and I'm just recording it,"" Parker said. Responses to the images are mostly positive, Parker said, but there's the occasional complaint that she's showing just one type of girl. It's true, Parker said: They're the ones she's raising, the only ones whose adventures she can document 24/7. She hopes the project inspires parents to find their own creative ways to capture their children's lives. More important, she wants kids to see they can be strong in whatever they are and whatever they hope to be. Parker's own kids still surprise her. ""Alice is a beautiful singer. When I hear her sing, it makes me cry,"" Parker said. ""Ella has this amazing, kind heart that cares more about the experience than the win. It's something that I did not teach her. ""Whatever it is, it's OK.""","Kate Parker is the photographer and mother behind ""Strong is the New Pretty""

Rangers won 4-1 at the 10-man Baggies on Saturday to end a losing run of five matches and clinch just their second away victory of the season. Chris Ramsey's side are still in the Barclays Premier League drop zone but are just three points behind fellow strugglers Aston Villa, who they travel to on Tuesday, with a better goal difference. Queens Park Rangers midfielder Joey Barton believes his side have a 'hell of a chance' of staying up . Barton, who scored at The Hawthorns, captained his side to a 4-1 away win against West Brom . QPR are just a point behind 17th-placed Sunderland . And Barton, who scored Rangers' fourth, is eyeing a late run which can take them to safety. 'We took our chances and hopefully it's a springboard for us to put a run together and make it difficult for the teams in and around the relegation zone,' he told the club's official website. 'There's a great amount of spirit in the group, a lot of people have written us off and we have an awful lot of work to do but performances like that give us a hell of a chance. 'We have been putting great performances in but we haven't got the rub of the green you need.' Bobby Zamora (left) scored QPR's third goal with an astounding lob from a narrow angle against West Brom . Eduardo Vargas (left) wheels away to celebrate firing QPR into the lead against West Brom . Eduardo Vargas, Charlie Austin and Bobby Zamora scored to put Rangers 3-0 up at the break with Zamora netting a fabulous lob just before half time. Zamora told the club's official site: 'I'm delighted to get on the scoresheet but it was a great performance from us. Villa have lost and Leicester have won so it's tight down there and we have to keep doing our job. It's a big game on Tuesday.' Albion are eight points clear of Rangers but suffered their heaviest defeat under Tony Pulis, despite Victor Anichebe's second-half header, and also had Youssouf Mulumbu sent off. Pulis added: 'We should have dealt better with their first goal. The second goal was from a set play. Zamora scored a great third goal and the fourth goal shouldn't have stood because Charlie Austin tripped Gareth McAuley. That was a poor decision by the referee.'","Queens Park Rangers strode to a 4-1 victory against the Baggies .

058add7f1d147491b54ac4c4ff0ecbf27992ebaa,"A transgender woman who had her face horribly damaged after it was injected with cement and tire sealant stepped out on Sunday showing off a new look. Rajee Narinesingh was one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, who performed illegal plastic surgeries using substances such as Fix-a-Flat, Super Glue and mineral oil. Rajee had Morris inject her cheeks, lips and chin back in 2005, and ended up disfigured after she did not have the money to go to a proper cosmetic surgeon. Scroll down for videos . Rajee Narinesingh (above), one of the victims of 'toxic tush' doctor Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend . Rajee was recently treated by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif in a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched . Left with a 'hard-as-rock' face, Rajee began seeing Dr John Martin of Coral Gables Cosmetic Reconstructive Surgery in 2012, who gave her softening injections and laser therapy to treat the botched surgery. In a 2014 interview she said that her new look was helping to boost her self-esteem, and that men were taking notice. 'Recently this guy said that being with me is like being with a sexy dragon,' she said at the time. 'I didn't know whether to slap him or kiss him.' Now, she has had her look improved once again by Dr Terry Dubrow and Dr Paul Nassif, a process that will be featured on the premiere episode of Botched. Rajee, who was born in New York but grew up in Philadelphia, explained when she realized she was a woman in that 2014 interview. She explained; 'Up until I was in my mid-twenties I just thought I was a feminine gay male. I thought about all the things I did when I was growing up - like taking the basketball my dad had bought me and instead of playing basketball with it I was simulating pregnancy and actually pretending to give birth and be a mommy. 'When I used to fantasize about being with guys I used to always picture myself with breasts and a vagina. I didn't realize I was doing it, it was just so natural for me. One day I just connected all the dots and thought ""you're not gay, you're transgender.""' Rajee lived in solitude and was afraid to go out after her face was left disfigured (above) That all changed in 2012 when she began receiving free treatments from Dr John Martin . Rajee, who had been too 'embarrassed and ashamed' to go to the authorities, claims she paid just $100 per session to Morris for the life-changing injections back in 2005. 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' she said of her decision to get the injections. 'If you really want to live your authentic self as a woman you need to do some sort of face and body reconstruction. 'So I made the choice to get injections done. In our community it is called pumping.' And while she knew she was not seeing a licensed surgeon, she was still excited the day she went to see Morris. 'When it finally came to the day, I was more excited than nervous because I was finally going to be the woman I had always wanted to be,' she said. 'There was a room that she had set up where she did a lot of medical procedures.' The room looked sterile and clean she said, and sokn after she arrived they began the procedure. 'I got injections in my face and my hips and my buttocks and initially I was fine,' said Rajee. 'But then the nightmare started.' 'The last thing I wanted was to look like a man in a dress. I wanted to be a beautiful woman,' Rajee (above) said of her decision to get the injections. Oneal Ron Morris (above, file photo) is accused of leaving women ill and disfigured after injecting them with a mixture of toxic substances, including super glue and Fix-A-Flat . She was left with a large boil on her face that kept growing bigger and bigger, and then 'green pus exploded out of my face and onto the mirror. It was green and yellow and mixed with blood.' She ended up spending years in solitude as a result of these botched procedures, until Dr Martin agreed to help her for free. Because of him, she says she has gone from 'victim to victorious.' She is also ready to start dating again, saying; 'I definitely deserve more than just the 3 o'clock in the morning knock on the window.' As for Morris, she is now facing manslaughter charges after one of her patients died following a procedure.","Rajee Narinesingh, one of the victims of 'toxic tush doctor 'Oneal Ron Morris, stepped out showing her new face over the weekend .

ec658fd1ef60b242f24cbc30f6be227798eec268,"Ferrari technical director James Allison believes Mercedes are again likely to lead the way in China this weekend. Fears of another season of domination from Mercedes were blown away by a shock, yet deserved victory for Sebastian Vettel last time out in Malaysia. It was the Maranello marque's first success for almost two years and at least offered hope to neutrals that reigning champion Lewis Hamilton and team-mate Nico Rosberg will not have it all their own way. Sebastian Vettel won the second race of the season with victory in Malaysia last month . Vettel saw off the challenge from Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg in Malaysia . In searing heat and high track temperatures the Ferraris of Vettel and Kimi Raikkonen were far kinder on their tyres, stopping only twice compared to the three trips to the pits for Hamilton and Rosberg. This weekend's race at the Shanghai International Circuit, however, should favour Mercedes given the cooler climes than that of Sepang. Allison is certainly not expecting back-to-back Ferrari wins and said: 'Our car has a pretty decent cooling package. 'That allowed us to operate in the fierce temperatures like we experienced in Malaysia without having to open up the car. 'The track was also rough and hot, which is hard for tyres, and we're fortunate the car goes well on its tyres. Hamilton celebrates his win in Australia . 'Quite what problems were going on in Merc-land I don't know. 'But I'm fairly sure we will have our work cut out in China to do as impressive a job as we did in Malaysia.' As to whether Ferrari can stay the course with Mercedes and provide a season-long challenge, for now that is too difficult to determine. 'I don't know about that. I'll tell you at the end of the season,' remarked Allison with a smile. 'In Melbourne (the season-opening Australian Grand Prix) Mercedes were very, very dominant, and we were better than we looked. 'Even in free air we wouldn't have held a candle to them there. 'There is a lot of work for us to do before we can head into every race weekend confident we can hunt for the victory from the first session of that weekend. 'But we do have a fairly exciting development plan, and we've a lot of performance to bring. 'It should at least be an interesting season to see if we can close that gap so we are genuine contenders at any weekend.' Crucially, and what may yet be a determining factor, Allison added: 'Normally over the course of a season being kind to your tyres is the best thing you can be.'","Ferrari won the second grand prix of the season in Malaysia .

dc92076d85c3317f5b90519832b1fc3fbdc99a15,"Marion 'Suge' Knight has been rushed to hospital for an unspecified medical emergency after a judge ruled on Thursday that he will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges. The former rap music mogul struck two men with his pickup truck in January, killing one and seriously injuring the other. Los Angeles sheriff's spokeswoman Nicole Nishida says Knight was transported to a hospital from the downtown courthouse. She says no further details could be released. Scroll down for video . 'Suge' Knight, pictured above on April 8, will stand trial on murder and attempted-murder charges following a hit-and-run, an LA judge said on Thursday . The parents of Suge Knight (pictured left) and his girlfriend (right) comfort each other outside the Los Angeles courthouse after learning on Thursday that he will stand trial for murder . Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen made the ruling on Thursday after concluding a hearing that focused heavily on testimony from Cle 'Bone' Sloan, who was hit outside a Compton burger stand in Los Angeles county. The judge also reduced bail from $25 million to $10 million. On Thursday morning, Knight walked out of court after the hearing. A message sent to Knight’s attorney Matt Fletcher wasn’t immediately returned. Sloan told detectives that he attacked Knight but testified on Monday that he didn't remember the fight and did not want to be a 'snitch'. Prosecutors played Sloan's statement to police, which offered a lucid, detailed account of the events on January 29 that led up to the deadly encounter. Authorities contend Knight intentionally hit the men, killing Terry Carter, 55. Suge Knight's parents seen leaving the courthouse in Los Angeles on Thursday after a judge ruled that their son will stand trial for murder and attempted murder . Victim Terry Carter's eldest daughter seen leaving court with attorney Carl Douglas after the announcement that Marion Suge Knight will stand trial for murder and attempted murder on Thursday . Knight's attorney, Matt Fletcher, said his client was ambushed and was trying to escape Sloan's attack when he ran over the men. Sloan's testimony demonstrated the difficulty in prosecuting Knight, who has gang ties and a reputation for intimidating witnesses. 'I will not be used to send Suge Knight to prison,' Sloan testified, adding that he was only on the stand because he was subpoenaed. Prosecutors granted Sloan, a former gang member who's known Knight for decades, limited immunity after he said he intended to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination. Knight, 49, was a key player in the gangster rap scene that flourished in the 1990s, and his label once listed Dr. Dre, Tupac Shakur and Snoop Dogg among its artists. Knight lost control of the company after it was forced into bankruptcy. Sloan, an adviser on the upcoming film 'Straight Outta Compton,' said he was trying to forget details of the crash, in which he suffered two fractured ankles, a serious cut to his head, two torn knee ligaments and a shoulder injury. 'Every day, I try to forget it,' Sloan said. 'I just know, I screwed up, and Terry's dead.' Sloan's memory troubles prompted the judge to comment on his testimony: 'I find that this witness is being deceptive.' The judge also heard from the lead detective investigating the case and watched security camera footage of the crash. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs -  at one hearing in March, a medical condition sent him to the hospital . The camera caught a limited view of the parking lot but shows Knight struggling with Sloan through the window of his truck before putting the vehicle in reverse, striking Sloan, then hitting him again and running over Carter while fleeing the scene. Fletcher, Knight's attorney, pressed Sloan on his feelings toward Knight and whether he was 'enraged' at him on the day of the crash. Sloan said he was mad but disputed that he told detectives he was enraged. Fletcher also painted Sloan as the aggressor, saying Knight 'hadn't attacked you in any form, fashion or manner. You agree?' 'Yes,' Sloan said. Knight faces up to life in prison if convicted in the case. He has prior felony convictions for armed robbery and assault with a gun. Knight pleaded no contest in 1995 and was sentenced to five years' probation in an assault on two rap entertainers at a Hollywood recording studio in 1992. The rap figure was sentenced to prison in February 1997 for violating terms of that probation by taking part in a fight at a Las Vegas hotel hours before Shakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by attack as he rode in Knight's car near the Strip. Shakur's slaying remains unsolved. Prosecutors only had to present a fraction of their evidence against Knight during the preliminary hearing that began on Monday. Knight's court hearings already have become dramatic affairs - he fired one set of attorneys during a hearing and medical conditions sent him to the hospital four times from courthouse appearances. He complained earlier this month when deputies brought him into court handcuffed to a wheelchair and has detailed health woes, including weight loss and blindness in one eye, when he's been allowed to speak in court.

Villagers in the small country hamlet of Cledford, near Middlewich in Cheshire, had vehemently opposed the plans saying that travellers could 'intimidate' nearby pensioners and may ruin the idyllic surroundings. But yesterday, Cheshire East Council gave the proposal the go ahead at a planning meeting, which will create a 'transit site' with room for nine gipsy families. The 200-year-old Cledford Hall in the small hamlet of Cledford in Cheshire which is being knocked down to make way for a 'Butlins-style' gipsy camp costing £3.2million . People living in the village have reacted with fury about the plans saying travellers could intimidate nearby pensioners . The mansion's Grade-II listed adjoining barn will be converted into 'washing and toilet' facilities and office accommodation for a resident warden will also be provided at the expense of taxpayers. The cost of the project, revealed through a Freedom of Information request, has left locals stunned, and they now fear their picturesque cottages will be left worthless as they contemplate selling up and leaving the area. Formerly Grade II-listed Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its listing was cancelled. It will be fully demolished to make way for the site which will house gypsy families for a maximum of 28 days before they must move on. Around 100 letters of opposition were handed to the council alongside a petition comprising 500 signatures but they will continue with the plans - which also include a play area - in efforts to put a stop to ‘unauthorised encampments’. The £3.2million cost of the project was only revealed through a Freedom of Information request and got the go ahead yesterday by Cheshire East Council . Cledford Hall, which dates back to 1822, was severely damaged by fire three years ago and its Grade-II listing was cancelled . Builder Bob Moody, 66, bought a ‘dream’ retirement cottage with his wife Trisha, 61, and has spent £130,000 renovating it with original Victorian fittings. It now lies, almost finished, at the site’s entrance but he is refusing to move into it and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market. He said: 'We’re totally gutted. We’re not going to live there now. Can we sell it? It’s going to be so hard to sell. We honestly don’t know what to do. 'Most of my life savings have gone into this cottage. Do we chop the price to half of what it was worth or do we sit on it? Would anybody want to rent it from opposite a gypsy site? 'We were so confident we were going to get somewhere in that meeting because we had strong arguments especially in regards to fire safety, as the plans put the caravans too close together which flouts regulations. Builder Bob Moody at the gates to the site with local residents Ken Roden and George Beevers. He says he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting . Mr Moody beside the house he bought in Cledford as a retirement home. He is refusing to move into the property and fears he could lose £100,000 if it is put on the market . 'If they have to be three metres apart they may have to reduce the number of caravans. That means they could be spending up to £5million to accommodate six to eight families. It’s ludicrous. 'These types of transit families in Cheshire can be obstructive, they may fight with police, defecate in hedges, leave rubbish everywhere. These are not the sort of neighbours that OAPs want opposite them.' At the planning meeting, the strategic planning board of Cheshire East Council had eight votes in favour of the site, with one against. Three members abstained from voting. Residents also raised concerns that the new site would destroy local wildlife which had settled on the site of Cledford Hall, including grass snakes, hedgehogs and toads. A planning permission sign next to Cledford Hall. Cheshire East Council say the development is needed to house travellers in the area . Mr Moody added: 'None of us can understand why the council should think it necessary to spend such a large amount of money providing a luxury Butlin’s-style holiday camp for travellers in such lovely countryside. 'There could be a minimum of between 80 and 100 gypsies and travellers at any time. Some may be very pleasant and law abiding, but you will always get the few who aren’t. 'They are only allowed to stay for 28 days so you can’t form a relationship with these people. If we get the odd ones that fight and get drunk and cause trouble it will be very intimidating.' Mr Moody explained he was only given three minutes to voice his concerns on behalf of residents at the planning meeting. He added: 'I’m going to talk to a lawyer to see if there is any way we can get compensation. 'It is the direct action of Cheshire East Council that has lost me nearly £100,000 and I can’t recover that cost. 'This has totally ruined my retirement and retirement plans. I haven’t set a date for my retirement now because our dream was to go to our little idyllic comfortable country cottage in the fields of Cheshire and that’s been shattered now.' Building work on the site is due to go ahead in the near future since the passing of the final stage of the application. Councillor Don Stockton, head of housing and jobs for Cheshire East Council who lives in the nearby town of Alderley Edge and was part of the applying team, said: 'We need a site somewhere in Cheshire East as we have a lot of travellers in the area and have had a lot of unapproved sites where travellers have been and we have not been able to move them. 'This is an approved site which we have investigated and compared with many others across the borough. It is very difficult to get these things sited and there has been plenty of public opposition. 'I know there has been a lot of public angst and people haven’t liked it but I’m afraid that is going to be the case wherever you would wish to put a transit site. 'I do feel sorry for the nearby residents. I think if the site was on my doorstep it’s just a case if wherever these things are sited it is bound to have opposition. 'It wouldn’t matter whether it was next to my house or anyone’s house. With the best will in the world we have to try and pick the best site possible. 'It’s just inevitable there is opposition and I’m very sorry for those who have a problem with that. We are under a legal obligation to have site for travellers.” Middlewich, which borders Cledford, was named the UK’s fourth most desirable place to live in a Royal Mail study last year.","Plans for site for travellers has been approved by East Cheshire Council .

The Virgin Mary Church was torched and looted by a mob, some of whom chanted against Coptic Christians and called for Egypt to become an ""Islamic state,"" one of at least 42 churches and many more businesses and homes targeted that August, the advocacy group Human Rights Watch reports. Others attacked included St. George Church in Sohag, a city south of Cairo on the Nile River, and Prince Tadros Church in Fayoum, which is southwest of Cairo, according to reports. In addition to those getting life sentences, two minors were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined 10,000 Egyptian pounds (about $1,300), Egypt's official Egynews reported. Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military. Morsy was sentenced to 20 years in prison earlier this month after being convicted on charges related to violence outside the presidential palace in December 2012. But he was acquitted of murder in the deaths of protesters. Christian churches across Egypt stormed, torched .

Supporters from both clubs say they are 'disgusted' at the continuing rise of ticket prices, with the protest coming in the aftermath of the announcement of the Premier League's £5.14billion TV rights deal with banners held up inside and outside the ground. With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from £64 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were £64, some of the highest prices in the Premier League . Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: '£5bn and what do we get? £64 a ticket'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool's Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices 'extortionate'. 'In the pursuit of money football has sold it's soul,' he said. 'The fans are that soul and no one cares about the match going fans. Arsenal and Liverpool fans unite outside the Emirates Stadium in a protest against ticket prices . Fans show off a banner reading 'FOOTBALL WITHOUT FANS IS NOTHING' outside the stadium before kick-off . 'We put up with late fixture changes, unreasonable kick off times and ridiculously high prices. We do it 'cos of the love of our team. 'But the tide is turning. Old rivalries are being put aside as fans from all clubs come together. Away fans help make the event but have to pay extortionate prices. Then we're told to ""sit down, shut up"".' Roy Bentham of Spirit of Shankly said: 'We want tangible reductions in line with what working class people earn. We may lose a generation or more of fans otherwise unless the footballing authorities wake up.'

7c97515b0e061ee4a09e7f4707852220b8f0bb1c,"(CNN)The latest outbreak of bird flu -- the worst in the U.S. since the 1980s -- is not a likely threat to humans, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But as with any potential threat to human health, they are preparing for the worst just in case. The CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture held a press conference Wednesday to talk about preparations. ""The risk to humans is low, our food supply is safe,"" said Dr. John Clifford, the USDA's Chief Veterinary Officer. ""We know how to address disease when we find it."" Since mid-December, 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry, backyard chickens, and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds, according to the CDC. That number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next. On Monday, health leaders in Iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there. In the United States, some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease, according to the USDA. Iowa has about 60 million laying hens, according to the Iowa Egg Council and is the top egg producer in the country. California and Minnesota, two of the country's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases. The news is bad for the birds, but not for humans. The CDC considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus ""low"" according to Dr. Alicia Fry, a medical officer with the CDC national Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, Influenza Division, Epidemiology and Prevention Branch. ""That said, human infections have occurred"" with another strain of the virus, found in Africa and in Asia, so the CDC cannot rule out the possibility of human infection, Fry said. ""We are cautiously optimistic"" that it won't spread to humans, but ""we are prepared for the possibility,"" she added. They are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed. The USDA is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds. These are typical routine public health preparedness measures. The CDC said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds. None of the workers have gotten sick themselves. Most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in Asia and Africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds. The virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs. Birds that are sick die quickly, according to Clifford. Incubation period is three to five days generally. With turkeys, they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called ""torticollis"" or ""stargazing"" he said, and they die shortly after that. Farmers also see a drop in egg production. Commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds. Workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination. With popular backyard birds, the USDA suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus. The CDC said, as with any evolving public health situation, they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available. The good news is the virus doesn't like warm weather or strong sunlight, according to the USDA. So the cases should go down over the summer, but they are going to monitor the situation knowing that it could come back in the Fall.","The CDC says ""the risk to humans is low,"" but, as always, they are preparing for the worst case .

d32bc944f0c14f50a89dd32eeac8e3f80fddd420,"The polls predict the Lib Dems face a bloodbath on election day, with dozens of their MPs fighting for their survival. But the metaphor became all too real for Stephen Gilbert when he was bitten by a dog while campaigning for re-election in Cornwall. He joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand. Lib Dem Stephen Gilbert posted this image online of his bloodied hand after being bitten by a dog on the campaign . Mr Gilbert is defending a majority of just 1,312 in St Austell and Newquay, and Lib Dem insiders today admitted the party is on course to lose at least 20 MPs on May 7. His run-in with the dog happened while canvassing this morning. The animal took a lump out of his right hand as he posted a leaflet through a letterbox. He posted a photo of his injury on Twitter. It showed him wiping away the blood with his handkerchief and the message: 'Am guessing this dog had unresolved anger issues.' But undeterred by the injury, and perhaps recognising that the Tories pose a bigger threat to his survival, he planned to return to the streets this afternoon. A Liberal Democrat spokesman said he was delivering a leaflets through doors at the time. He said: 'He was out in the constituency delivering a leaflet through a letter box when the dog bit him. It is a hazard of the job and all politicians are vulnerable to it. 'Stephen has been treated at the minor injuries unit at the local hospital this morning and has been bandaged up with a few painkillers. He will be back on the campaign trail this afternoon.' Mr Gilbert joked that the dog had 'unresolved anger issues' after posting a photograph online of his bloodstained hand . A quarter of MPs have admitted to being chased or bitten by a dog while out campaigning for re-election, a study showed earlier this month. Cornwall is a major battleground for the Lib Dems, with three seats coming under heavy fire from the Tories. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Hampshire where the Lib Dems held Eastleigh after Chris Huhne was jailed. But behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support,  to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge. Mr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling.","Stephen Gilbert jokes that the dog 'unresolved anger issues' after bite .

During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for. Mr Osborne said it would come from the Conservatives’ ‘balanced plan’ for the economy, but declined to go into further detail. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne and Labour Deputy Leader Harriet Harman, appearing on BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show . In one exchange, Mr Marr said: ‘You’ve just found an extra £8billion. All I’m asking is where does it come from? No higher taxes, extra public spending cuts? Where?’ Mr Osborne replied: 'Well it’s part of our balanced plan. And if you look over the last five years …’ But Mr Marr interjected: ‘That’s not really an answer, Chancellor.’ Harriet Harman was left squirming yesterday after ‘posh’ George Osborne revealed on the Andrew Marr show that they had attended the same £21,000-a-year private school. She went to St Paul’s Girls’ school in West London while Mr Osborne attended the boys’ school. During tense exchanges with the BBC’s Andrew Marr, the Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions about exactly how the massive cash boost would be paid for . Mr Osborne insisted, however, that the Conservatives had shown in government that they were able to make the savings necessary to deliver additional funding for the NHS. Migrants will have to pay in more than £20,000 in taxes before they receive access to the benefits system under Tory plans. Home Secretary Theresa May said the new rules would end welfare tourism and make the UK less attractive to Eastern European migrants. New arrivals will be banned from claiming benefits until they have paid into the system for four years. The plan to ensure that they have to pay £22,600 in tax and national insurance before they can claim a penny will be part of the Tory manifesto. European job hunters would be denied unemployment benefits and forced to leave within six months if they do not find work. Those who get a job would be denied in-work benefits, including council housing, for four years. They will also be refused child benefit for offspring living anywhere else in Europe. ‘We have a balanced plan to grow our economy, to make savings in government including in welfare to fund our NHS each and every year,’ he said. ‘We have to make similar savings each year that we have made for five years of this parliament but for two years. ‘We have a track record in this parliament where we found almost £8billion extra in real terms for the National Health Service in very, very difficult economic circumstances so we have proved our mettle, we have proved our ability to stand behind the National Health Service in this parliament. We can do it in the next.’ Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman, who also appeared on the programme, said the promise was ‘illusory’ and that Tory spending plans represented a ‘real threat’ to the health service. ‘The reality is that the spending programme that they have put forward is a threat to cut the NHS,’ she said. ‘People know that they find it harder to see their GP since the Tories came into government, they know that they wait longer in accident and emergency and that waiting lists are starting to grow.’","During exchanges with  Marr, Chancellor repeatedly ducked questions .

The White House said today that Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month held in honor of the Japanese Prime Minister, confirming rumors that Bernard, 53, would soon exit the administration. The first lady said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy,' she added. 'Jeremy will be missed, and Barack and I wish him the very best in all of his future endeavors.' The first lady, pictured here in November 2011 with White House Social Secretary Jeremy Bernard in Hawaii, said in a statement she was 'lucky to have such a talented individual on my team.' Obama added, 'I am equally lucky to have made a lifelong friend in Jeremy' The White House did not name a replacement for Bernard, who is also the first gay man to hold the position, nor did it explain why he was leaving. Michelle Obama spoke highly of his time on staff, however, saying, 'For the last four years, Jeremy has worked tirelessly to open the doors of the White House to as many people as possible and to make each and every event in the White House one to remember, not only for Barack and me, but for the tens of thousands of guests who pass through our doors each year.' Bernard simply stated that it's been an 'honor' to serve the Obamas and lauded the first lady for welcoming 'every guest to the White House with her signature warmth, grace and style.' 'I feel so privileged to have worked for such an extraordinary President and First Lady,' his statement read. The former California resident told the Washington Post that he planned to return to The Golden States, and he's 'really looking for some time to think about what’s next and spend some quality time with Garbo, my rescue beagle.' Bernard is pictured here catching snowflakes on the Colonnade of the White House in this February 2014 photo captured by the building's official photographer. The White House today confirmed that Bernard, 53, would depart after a state dinner next month . According to a profile of Bernard in Vogue, Bernard stumbled into politics in the early '90s while waiting tables in Los Angeles. There he met a fundraiser for then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, Dave Mixner, who brought him under his wing and into Clintonland. Bernard later formed a California-based political consulting firm with his ex-boyfriend, Democratic operative Rufus Gifford, that became the vehicle for Barack Obama's West Coast fundraising during his first campaign for president. Obama rewarded Bernard for his hard work with an appointment as the White House's liaison to the National Endowment for the Humanities. He briefly served as the chief of staff to the U.S. Ambassador to France in 2010 before accepting the position of social secretary the following year with his boss' blessing. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as social secretary since February 2011, carefully avoiding the limelight, unlike his predecessor Desirée Rogers, the first African-American social secretary, who was forced out of the administration after just 13 months on the job. It was during Rogers' tenure that socialites Michaele and Tareq Salahi crashed a White House state dinner in 2009. The couple went on to start in Bravo's Real Housewives of D.C. reality TV series. No such mishaps happened during the tenure of Bernard, whose behind-the-scenes work kept the White House in shipshape during social events. His first interview since taking the job, the Vogue profile, did not hit newsstands until February of this year - his fourth anniversary as social secretary. Asked for the interview why he believes he was chosen for the job, Bernard said, 'I would imagine part of it is a trust issue. I was there from the beginning. I was a known quantity. They certainly knew that I was loyal and supportive.' This March 18 photo shows, from left to right, Jeremy Bernard, Democratic operative Karen Finney, Executive Director of the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities Rachel Goslins, and former Obama administration officals Stephanie Cutter at the ELLE and HUGO BOSS Women in Washington Power List Dinner at The Residence of the German Ambassador. Barrier-breaking Bernard has served quietly as White House social secretary since February 2011 and has carefully avoiding the limelight for the better part of his tenure . Under Bernard's watch, the White House has moved from formal printed invitations for many events to an email system. It has also shed the tradition of seating husbands and wives away from each other at dinners. Bernard told Vogue his team had received 'some criticism' for departing from the traditional seating chart, but it done in accordance with the first lady's will. 'it does bring a comfort level,' he said, of husbands and wives being allowed to sit together. 'And I believe that was part of what Mrs. Obama wanted. 'It is still the White House, still very historic and traditional, but it doesn’t have to be uncomfortable.' Speaking to the Washington Post about his impeding departure, Bernard summed up his work as making 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue 'as open as possible and to grant access to as many people as possible, especially people who had never been to the house before.' 'It’s easy to fall into patterns, and what Mrs. Obama has been able to do is have an attitude that keeps it fresh,' he said. At the time of the Vogue interview, which was conducted over several months, dating back to the beginning of November even though it was not published until February, Bernard claimed not to know what his next professional move would be and said he was focusing on the last two years of the Obamas' residency in the White House. 'The good thing about this job—and perhaps the bad thing—is that I am not able to think about the future,' he said. Bernard said that a previous White House social secretary told him 'she lost sleep toward the end because people told her she would go on to do great things next, but they never told her what.' 'She warned me that I do have to start thinking about it,' he recalled. 'I know I do; I just haven’t yet. I’m sort of putting my head in the sand.'","White House said today that Jeremy Bernard would depart after a state dinner next month, confirming rumors he'd soon exit the administration .

A conman has been jailed for stealing a pensioner's entire £401,000 life savings and using it to finance his dream wedding and honeymoon. Kevin Franklin married his new wife in the Italian Alps while his 80-year-old victim was forced to borrow money from his children because he could not afford any milk, a court heard. The 58-year-old siphoned off the £400,001 fortune over an eight-year period but when he was finally arrested he told police: 'I played him.' He was jailed for four-and-a-half years at Warwick Crown Court yesterday after admitting fraud and deception after the judge ignored his plea for leniency because he was 'terrified' of going to prison. Sentencing him judge Alan Parker said: 'You plainly saw him as a soft target and you used him, and used him and used him. 'You told lies, some of them beyond wicked, and always you knew he would pay up. 'You lived a lavish lifestyle at the cost of an elderly man's life savings. Society demands that you should be punished.' He told the 80-year-old a string of lies that led to the elderly chartered accountant losing his Birmingham office and was forced to put his 'beautiful' home up for sale, the court heard. Franklin stole his money after telling him his sister had died in Canada and he desperately needed to fly there. He then said his father had died and needed a loan  until he inherited £500,000 - but in fact Franklin's father had died 20 years earlier. Before his fraud was revealed he had said that bailiffs were at the door demanding money. The victim was introduced to Franklin in 2005 and agreed to lend £15,000 for refurbishments to a restaurant Franklin ran in Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire. Shocking: Franklin was jailed at Warwick Crown Court, pictured, which heard that his victim's life was made 'a disaster' because he was left without any money to buy a pint of milk . From there, Franklin fabricated sob story after sob story in an attempt to wring ever more cash from the pensioner, including tens of thousands more in loans. But Franklin, a former car dealership manager, was living the high life and even used the money for his Italian Alps wedding and honeymoon. Meanwhile the pensioner had ran out of money and endured days filled with fear. In a statement, he said the pressure had become overwhelming as Franklin's demands took over his life. 'My financial situation is a disaster,' he added. 'At times we have been so short of money to pay for basic food that we have had to search our pockets to get enough for a litre of milk.' Defending, Lee Marklew said Franklin's personal life had been destroyed by the case, and his wife had left him. 'The thought of the inevitable custodial sentence has been utterly terrifying,' he said. 'Since his arrest it has been a palpable fear which has affected the quality of his life.' But the judge ignored his plea and jailed him.","Kevin Franklin left his 80-year-old victim without any money to buy milk .

The Spaniard warned Bayern remained lethal even though they were missing several big names including Arjen Robben and David Alaba. 'We have to produce a great performance against one of the greatest teams in the history of Bayern,' Lopetegui, whose team are unbeaten in the competition this season, said.

Bayern are also without Javi Martinez and Mehdi Benatia, while winger Franck Ribery looks set to miss the game with a nagging ankle injury. Germany captain Bastian Schweinsteiger returned to team training on Monday but he is also doubtful to start having been out for weeks with an ankle injury and a subsequent virus.

b882ed05925f8879660ec4f9efdcded1d5e45561,"(CNN)One year after it was perpetrated, the kidnapping of nearly 300 schoolgirls by a jihadist group in Nigeria remains a crime almost too horrifying to comprehend: Hundreds of teenaged girls, just finishing school, destined perhaps for significant achievement -- kidnapped, never to be seen again. ""This crime has rightly caused outrage both in Nigeria and across the world,"" the country's President-elect, Muhammadu Buhari, said Tuesday in marking the anniversary. ""Today is a time to reflect on the pain and suffering of the victims, their friends and families. Our thoughts and prayers, and that of the whole Nigerian nation, are with you today."" The girls were abducted on the night of April 14-15, 2014, in the town of Chibok, in northeastern Nigeria, about a two-hour drive from the border with Cameroon. The Government Girls Secondary School had been closed for a month because of the danger posed by Boko Haram militants, who are opposed to Western education, particularly for girls. But students from several schools had been called in to take a final exam in physics. The militants stormed the school, arriving in a convoy of trucks and buses and engaging in a gun battle with school security guards. Then they forced the girls from their dormitories, loaded them into trucks and drove them into the forest. Most have never been seen since, except in a photograph in which they sat on the ground in a semi-circle, clad in Islamic dress. They were between 16 and 18 years old. Police said the militants kidnapped 276 girls in all. About 50 managed to escape soon after they were abducted. Those who did not, it is feared, may have been raped, brutalized, enslaved and forced to convert to Islam. Their parents were stricken with grief. The world was appalled. On Twitter, a hashtag began trending and spread around the world: #BringBackOurGirls. On Tuesday, Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot in the face for speaking out in favor of girls' education, sent a message to the kidnapped girls. ""I am one of the millions of people around the world who keep you and your families foremost in our thoughts and prayers,"" she wrote. ""We cannot imagine the full extent of the horrors you have endured. But please know this: We will never forget you."" One year later, a few things have changed. Each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity. Each is now a year older. Nigeria's current president, Goodluck Jonathan, was defeated in his campaign for re-election, in part, it is thought, because he failed to effectively combat Boko Haram. Buhari, the incoming president, has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group. But much remains unchanged, as well. Boko Haram still controls swathes of northeastern Nigeria. According to UNICEF, 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the Nigerian military, civilian self-defense groups, and Boko Haram. Amnesty International says women and children continue to be abducted. And it says Boko Haram continues to kill in large numbers. Beyond that, more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing.  Their families are still bereft. And Tuesday on Twitter, a hashtag was still trending: #BringBackOurGirls.","Nigeria's President-elect sends nation's prayers to families of girls .

Ashley Madison, an online dating agency, is betting on Europe's relaxed attitude to boost its investment when it lists shares on the stock market in London later this year. It's founder Noel Biderman, 43, who came up with the idea for the site in the 1990s when he worked as a sports attorney, wants to raise money from investors to fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states. Scroll down for video . Noel Biderman, 43, (pictured) who is the founder of Ashley Madison - a Canadian dating website for married people - wants to raise money from British investors to fund a launch of its services elsewhere in the world . Ashley Madison, a Canadian online dating agency which boasts 'life is short, have an affair', is targeting British investors for stock shares because of the UK's supposed 'laissez faire' attitude to extra-marital affairs . With more than 34 million members worldwide, Ashley Madison claims to be the world's second-largest dating website. Only Match.com is bigger. Despite being happily married himself, father-of-two Mr Biderman, who was born in Canada, claims infidelity can actually save relationships and believes people 'use affairs to preserve their marriage'. He is a self-made multi-millionaire having successfully launched the company in Toronto before rolling it out in other major nations. Avid Life Media, the parent company of Ashley Madison, values itself at £669million ($1 billion) and had a reported revenue of £77million ($115 million) in 2014 alone - up 45 percent from the preceding year. Mr Biderman believes the website is such a success because it gives members the 'perfect affair' - helping them cheat on their partner with like-minded people and reducing their chances of getting caught in the act. He now wants to raise up to £135million ($200 million) by listing shares for Ashley Madison in London this year, to help continue its growth worldwide. It comes five years after a lack of investor appetite caused it to pull an attempt to list in Canada. Avid Life Media has 1.2million customers in the UK and 35million worldwide but was forced to scrap a flotation in Toronto in 2010 after investors weren't convinced to buy in. Mr Biderman came up with the idea for Ashley Madison in the 1990s when he was working as a sports attorney. He said he realised there was a space in the market for the site after watching stars arrange affairs . Mr Biderman claims to have been happily married to his wife Amanda for 10 years and the pair have two sons . The company hopes success in London will help it fund a launch of its services in Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states in late May or June. Membership is growing quickest in India, South Korea and Japan. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors to the site are greeted by a brunette woman, who is extending her finger across her lips in a shushing gesture. She is wearing what appears to be a wedding ring. Christoph Kraemer, director of international relations for Ashley Madison said: 'It is for people who are married, who are seeking an affair and want to do so in a discreet environment. 'In Europe, we have simply got a more laissez faire attitude towards a business such as ours.' Mr Kraemer also believes the website can actually help married couples, by 'igniting a spark in their marriage'. He said: 'The response we get from our members who have actually had an affair via the website is that they feel happier, invigorated and transmit that happiness, which actually reinforces and ignites a spark in their marriage and relationships.' Avid Life Media, which is backed financially by a number of anonymous investors, owns also various other similar websites including Cougarlife.com and EstablishedMen.com. Ashley Madison's website allows members to sign up without disclosing personal information such as their name, telephone number or home address. Visitors are greeted by a brunette woman with a finger to her lips . Married father-of-two Neil Biderman, 43, (pictured) is the man behind dating website Ashley Madison . The founder of the world’s largest online dating agency for extra-marital activity which boasts ‘life is short, have an affair’ is a multi-millionaire father-of-two who claims to have been happily married for 10 years. Neil Biderman, 43, the man behind dating website Ashley Madison, has made millions from his unique website which offers married partners the chance to have an affair with other spouses. However, despite his hugely successful business, Canadian-born Mr Biderman – who is often referred to as ‘the king of infidelity’ claims he has never cheated on his wife Amanda and remains happily married. The couple have two sons. Despite his loyalty claims, Mr Biderman did once reveal that he wouldn’t hesitate to cheat if the sexual relationship with his wife dried up. Speaking to the Evening Standard last year, he said: ‘We’re incredibly communicative about our sexual needs. ‘But if I woke up beside my wife and it was the 200th day we hadn’t been intimate with one another and it looked like nothing would change, I would cheat so fast. ‘I would cheat long before I would get a divorce. If you have children that you love and a home that you built together and a future that you planned — why would you give that up just for sex?’ Mr Biderman came up with the idea for the extra-marital dating site in the 1990s, after a career as a sports attorney apparently made him realise how much time and money his clients spent on mistresses while they were away on tour. The site has made him a self-made multi-millionaire and he claims it is worth at least £669million ($1 billion). Despite its risqué nature, Mr Biderman’s wife doesn’t appear to mind because she agrees it is a ‘sound business idea’. The pair insist the social network is just a tool and no one can force anyone to betray a spouse and even believe the dating website can actually help save marriages. M Biderman said previously: ‘The reason people have affairs is that they want to stay married. ‘What I get is a lot of people who come back to me and say: 'Listen, this has made me a better partner.' ‘They were angry and taking things out on their family. The sexual frustration they were feeling, they start having the affair and all of a sudden, that stress is removed. It's very cathartic for those people. ‘If you come home and you've had an affair earlier in the day, it might be easier not to be frustrated with your partner. The conversation could take a different directional tone and that can lead to intimacy. He also has previously said: ‘My belief is that people use affairs to preserve their marriage.’","Canadian adultery website to list shares in London in bid to boost revenue .

Before and after images show how the wave of snow, ice and rock flattened the usually serene 18,000-foot-altitude base camp on Saturday. The avalanche started on Mount Kumori, a 23,000-foot-high mountain just a few miles from Everest, and gathered strength as it tore across the world's highest peak. Half an hour after the initial quake, another magnitude-6.6 aftershock hit, followed by smaller aftershocks across the region. Eighteen people died in the avalanche, including four Americans, and 61 were injured, according to Nepal's mountaineering department. Scroll down for videos .

His wife Corey Fryer told the station he died 'doing what he loved'. On Sunday the first survivors were flown off Everest by aid helicopters and began sharing their incredible stories of survival. Bhim Bahudar Khatri, a cook for a climbing team, said: 'I was cooking for my team in the meal tent when the earthquake hit. We all rushed out to the open and the next moment a huge wall of snow just piled on me. 'I managed to dig out of what could easily have been my grave. I wiggled and used my hands as claws to dig as much as I could. I was suffocating, I could not breathe. But I knew I had to survive. 'I dug a few more feet until I was out of the snow and could breathe. I looked around and saw the tents all torn, crushed and many people injured. I had lived, but lost many of my friends.' An Everest guide, Pemba Sherpa, 43, added: 'I was resting in my tent when the earthquake hit. I heard a big noise and the next thing I know I was swept away by the snow.

Recovery: A group is seen carrying an injured climber in their sleeping bag; more than 60 people were injured in the incident . Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest . 'When I regained consciousness, I was in a tent surrounded by foreigners. I did not know what happened or where I was.' He said the toll on Everest was sure to rise: 'There are still many people who are still missing on the mountain. There were several tents buried by the snow, several blown away.' Michael Churton, a filmmaker from New York, was with four other colleagues at the base camp when the earthquake hit, and he said that it took about 45 seconds for the avalanche to finish. 'I told the group to get down,' he said. 'It was about 4,000 feet of snow just coming and there was nowhere to run.' After curling up into a fetal position, he was thrown into a rock, which left him with cuts to his face and a black eye - but he was otherwise uninjured. Mountaineering instructor Chris Harling, 41, from Keswick, Cumbria, has spoken of the terrifying moment he felt the ground 'turn to jelly under his feet' after the earthquake hit Mount Everest. Speaking from his sleeping bag at base camp on the north side of the mountain, the experienced climber said his group took cover after rocks the size of cars came crashing down around them. 'At first we could feel the trembling under the tent, but it was eerie as there was no noise, it was silent. Then it felt like we were shaking on a huge plate of jelly,' he said. 'It was so strange feeling the ground turn to jelly under our feet and we thought the mountain would start crashing down on us.' The instructor from Adventure Peaks, who was leading a group of eight clients on their first trip up the mountain, said the area was badly hit by rock falls, but they all escaped injury. Killed: Three Americans died on the mountain: Dr Marisa Eve Girawong, 29, (left), who was working as a medic at the time, Google exec Dan Fredinburg, 33, (center with his ex-girlfriend, actress Sophia Bush) and documentary filmmaker Tom Taplin, 61 (right) Heading out: Rescuers carry a sherpa injured by the avalanche. The quake is believed to have killed more than 4,000 people . Heading home: A rescue helicopter prepares to land on Sunday and the first survivors were carried off the mountainside . 'Sure enough, an area of steep cliffs did break off sending car sized boulders hurtling down only a few hundred metres from our tents. We are still feeling aftershocks hours later. 'We were very lucky as no one in our group has been injured, but one climber was struck by a boulder.' He said their main priority was now working out how to leave base camp and make their way home, as the road to Kathmandu has been obliterated by the quake. 'We are trapped and have nowhere to go, we can't get back to Kathmandu, the road has been completely destroyed and there is absolutely no way to get through.' Climber Garrett Madison, who runs Seattle-based firm Madison Mountaineering, described how he was leading his group up the mountain when he heard the terrifying sound of avalanches. 'We heard an awful noise and heard avalanches coming down either side of the valley,' he said. 'We thought we were going to get wiped out but we were only dusted by a snow cloud. We proceeded up to Camp Two and contacted Base Camp where we heard of the awful destruction.' On Monday, it emerged that the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 4,400 people, with more than 8,000 injured. The toll is expected to rise as assessments are made in vulnerable mountain villages that have been inaccessible since the quake. Nepalese officials have speculated that the number of casualties could reach as high as 10,000.","Photographs taken after the 7.8-magnitude earthquake sparked an avalanche on Mount Everest on Saturday show the campsite buried beneath snow and belongings strewn across the mountain .

11a43ead0e7e502445f36c1fe69c54919064238f,"A heavily pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman  and her baby died after she was diagnosed with leukemia but refused a blood transfusion that would probably have saved both of their lives. The 28-year-old was diagnosed with the cancer seven months into her pregnancy, and doctors told her she could  give birth via a caesarean section and undergo chemotherapy but both would require her to have a blood transfusion. The Sydney woman refused both options due to her religious beliefs and her baby died in utero three days later. She had a stillbirth and died 13 days after her diagnosis after suffering a stroke and multi-organ failure. A pregnant Jehovah's Witness woman and her baby have died after she refused a blood transfusion . Her treating haematologist at the Prince of Wales Hospital in Randwick, Dr Giselle Kidson-Gerber, said the mother understood the risks of her refusal to accept blood. 'Her refusal to receive a blood transfusion meant that we were unable to perform a caesarean section and to deliver the foetus,' Dr Kidson-Gerber told Daily Mail Australia. 'Obviously it's a very big ethical issue. Legally in Australia the mother has the right to make decisions on her behalf and her foetus's behalf. 'Most mothers would make decisions in favour of the unborn baby and this was a decision that was not in favour of the unborn baby.' Dr Kidson-Gerber added: 'If we were to give chemotherapy without blood transfusion support she surely would have died.' Hospital staff were 'distressed' over what were perceived to be two avoidable deaths, as 83 percent of pregnant leukemia sufferers go into remission with treatment. Dr Kidson-Gerber said it was a challenge to respect a patient who refuses life-saving treatment. 'It was sad. I think that I did my best to help her. But ultimately I couldn't change the course of events,' she said. The 28-year-old had pregnancy complications due to her leukemia but rejected treatment on religious grounds . In a recent  article published in the Internal Medicine Journal about the 2009 case, Dr Kidson-Gerber and her colleague Dr Amber Biscoe wrote: 'Not administering blood products in this case undoubtedly contributed to the death of mother and foetus. 'Refusal of a lifesaving intervention by an informed patient is generally well respected, but the rights of a mother to refuse such interventions on behalf of her foetus is more controversial.' Sascha Callaghan, an expert in ethics and law at the University of Sydney said the current law allows the mother to make decisions that would directly affect her unborn baby, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. She said Jehovah's Witnesses are often condemned for their beliefs, especially in relation to their stance against blood transfusions. 'This woman has a long-held commitment to the Jehovah's Witness faith and that's how she chose to die,' she told the Herald. 'When your foetus is in utero, it is inextricably tied to your life.' The woman was being treated at the Royal Hospital for Women and the Prince of Wale Hospital in Randwick . Jehovah's Witnesses refuse blood transfusions because they believe the Bible commands them to abstain from ingesting blood and that avoiding blood pays respect to God as the giver of life.","Jehovah's Witness and her baby have died after refusing blood transfusion .

The unverified video shows the rocket drifting  onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over. On Tuesday, SpaceX came incredibly close to landing its Falcon 9 rocket booster on a barge in the middle of the Atlantic. Now, leaked footage reveals just how close Elon Musk's firm came to success, with a close-up view of the daring attempt shot on a GoPro camera . A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster caused by a gust of wind. The video, which appeared on Reddit, reveals how the rocket overcompensates for its extreme tilt. A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve designed to control the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough. As a result, the actions from rocket's computers couldn't be acted upon in time to correct the tilt of the booster. Earlier this week SpaceX has released its own dramatic footage of its third attempt to land a rocket booster on a barge in the Atlantic. The video, taken from a plane , shows the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before exploding on impact. The maneuver was attempted following the launch of the Falcon 9 rocket a few minutes earlier from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Soon after the launch, billionaire SpaceX founder, Musk, tweeted: 'Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival.' The unverified video shows the rocket drifting into view in slow motion and floating onto its target before a gust of wind topples it over . Pictured is the moment of impact.  A deleted tweet by Musk says that the rocket appeared to be suffering from 'stiction in the biprop throttle valve, resulting in control system phase lag.' This means the valve controlling the flow propellent and oxidiser to the engine wasn't moving fast enough . Landing the rocket upright was always going to be tricky. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand. The autonomous spaceport drone ship is 300ft by 100ft (90 by 30 metres), with wings that extend its width to 170ft (50 metres). Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year. Despite being destroyed, the booster's flyback marks another step in the company's quest to develop rockets that can be refurbished and reflown, potentially slashing launch costs. 'This might change completely how we approach transportation to space,' SpaceX Vice President Hans Koenigsman told reporters during a prelaunch press conference. The Falcon 9 is on now its way to deliver 4,300lb (1,950 kg) of food, clothing and science experiments to the ISS - including an eagerly awaited espresso machine for astronauts. The supplies today arrived at the ISS. The rocket was was due to take off on Monday, but the launch was  scrubbed due to bad weather. The video, taken from a plane on Tuesday, shows the the Falcon 9 booster lowering itself onto the platform, before a gust of wind sways it to one side . On board the Dragon capsule was an experimental espresso machine intended for International Space Station astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti of Italy. 'We're very, very happy to have it here,' Cristoforetti radioed to mission controllers in Houston today. The Italians in charge of the project hope to revolutionise coffee-drinking in space. SpaceX, meanwhile, hoped to transform the rocket business by landing the first-stage booster on a platform floating a few hundred miles off Florida's northeastern coast, near Jacksonville. United Launch Alliance has unveiled radical plans to launch a reusable rocket named 'Vulcan' in 2019. Vulcan will use new engines, mid-air recovery and a new upper stage aimed at enabling complex on-orbit manoeuvres. The company appears to have timed the announcement to overshadow SpaceX' launch of Falcon 9, which today hoped to prove that reusable rockets are viable. The aim of both SpaceX and ULA is to end US dependence on Russian-built rocket engines, but the technology has so far proven difficult. ULA's plan is to skip returning the whole booster, an approach favoured by rival SpaceX. It hopes to separate the engines after launch, inflate a heat shield around them and dispatch a helicopter to nab them mid-air. The booster managed to land on the barge but Elon Musk said that 'excess lateral velocity' caused it to tip over . Elon Musk tweeted this image of the booster coming back down to Earth. Musk had put 50-50 odds on the attempt being successful and said that improvements to the design would happen throughout the year . The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions' in the Atlantic ocean . Musk's plan is to reuse his booster rockets rather than discard them as is the custom around the world, to reduce launch costs. First-stage boosters normally just slam into the Atlantic and sink. The booster was programmed, following separation 2.5 minutes after liftoff, to flip around and fly to the platform dubbed 'Just Read the Instructions.' The Dragon — the only supply ship capable of returning items intact — will remain at the space station until around May 21. During a previous landing attempt in January, the rocket ran out of hydraulic fluid for its steering fins, causing it to crash into the platform. A second attempt in February was called off because of high seas, but the rocket successfully ran through its pre-programmed landing sequence and hovered vertically above the waves before splashing down and breaking apart. At liftoff time, the orbiting lab was soaring over Australia. The delivery of food and equipment arrived today . The launch sequence as it happened. All stages of the launch went to plan, except for the landing of the lower part of the rocket. SpaceX once compared it to balancing a broomstick on your hand . Musk recently unveiled the images of the Falcon 9 failed second landing after persuasion on Twitter by the game pioneer behind Doom, John Carmack. The images show the rocket approaching the barge following last month's attempt. After it fails to reduce its speed, the rocket is seen crashing at an angle and exploding. Billionaire Musk described the event simply as a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly'. This is the California-based SpaceX company's seventh station supply run since 2012, all from Cape Canaveral. SpaceX is one of two companies hired by Nasa to fly cargo to the station following the retirement of the space shuttles. As well as a recently extended 15-flight, $2 billion contract with Nasa, SpaceX is working on a passenger version of the Dragon capsule and has dozens of contracts to deliver commercial communications satellites into orbit. The company also is working on a heavy-lift version of the Falcon rocket, which uses 27 engines, compared to the nine currently flying. The Falcon Heavy is expected to make its first test flight late this year. While the booster landing didn't go to plane, the launch was successful. It took place at 4.10 ET from Florida under perfect conditions, after a attempt had to be scrubbed on Monday due to lightning .","On Tuesday, SpaceX made a third attempt to land booster on a barge .

With Tom Boonen and Fabian Cancellara - winners of six of the last 10 races here - missing through injury, Thomas was one of the favourites to claim the title following his recent victory in E3 Harelbeke and third-place finish at the Gent-Wevelgem sprint classic. He was in contention for much of Sunday's race as Team Sky set the pace in the peloton for lengthy periods, but the Welshman was unable to recover ground as Kristoff (Team Katusha) and Terpstra (Etixx - Quick-Step) launched a late breakaway. Alexander Kristoff celebrates by spraying champagne after winning the Tour of Flanders . Norway's Kristoff poses after beating off competition from Niki Terpstra to win the Tour of Flanders race . The highly-fancied Kristoff came home in a time of six hours, 26 minutes and 38 seconds, with Terpstra just behind and local hope Greg van Avermaet of Belgium (BMC) seven seconds back in third. Thomas, looking to become only the second Briton to win the event after Tom Simpson in 1961, finished in the chasing pack almost a minute back. It was not to be for Team Sky, who had pushed hard throughout as they sought their first win in one of cycling's big five classic one-day races - and one that was not short of incident. Sir Bradley Wiggins, in one of his last rides for Team Sky, was one of a number of riders to hit the deck during the race when he crashed in the middle of the peloton while trying to negotiate a tight left-hand turn. Team Sky's Geraint Thomas finished in 14th position after struggling to close the gap on the likes of Kristoff . Although he needed a spare bike, Wiggins was able to continue but other riders suffered worse with New Zealander Jesse Sergent - who was part of a seven-man breakaway group - suffering what was feared to be a fractured collarbone after being hit by a neutral service car as it tried to overtake him. Incredibly, there was another incident involving a support car later on which saw Sebastien Chavanel also knocked off his bike and out of the race. The Frenchman was hit by his team car after it had been rear-ended by another vehicle. Other riders were also involved in spills on the testing surfaces while there was a near moment of farce when one of the inflatable markers straddling the road started to deflate, leaving the riders with barely enough room to get underneath without having to break stride. The late drama was created by Kristoff and Terpstra, though. They escaped the pack with around 30 kilometres left and, with no one able to catch them, it was down to one of them to take the crown. Terpstra bided his time on the final straight as he sat on Kristoff's wheel waiting for the right moment to attack, but when he did the Norwegian reacted and left his rival trailing as he claimed his second 'Monument' title after his Milan-San Remo triumph in 2014.","Norway's Alexander Kristoff won race after sprint finish with Niki Terpstra .

All four matches mark Chelsea’s participation in this summer’s pre-season International Champions Cup with Manchester United, who Mourinho’s side will not face, LA Galaxy, Porto and San Jose Earthquakes also involved. ‘I’m pleased we are able to announce our fixtures for what promises to be an exciting summer,' said Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck. ‘As promised, we face some excellent opposition across several iconic venues in the United States and to top it off we are delighted to be hosting Fiorentina at Stamford Bridge in front of our loyal fans. ‘The tour allows us to prepare fully for the 2015/16 campaign, and I am also pleased to confirm we will be continuing the important work of the Chelsea Foundation during the trip.’ United reached the final of the 2014 International Champions Cup, beating Liverpool 3-1 in Miami, but had travelled about 13,500 miles during the two-and-a-half week tournament. They played LA Galaxy, Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid before the final, with 109,318 fans packed inside of The Big House to witness their 3-1 win against the Spanish giants in Michigan.","Chelsea to play three matches inside six days in the United States .

Christopher Swain wore a protective yellow suit as he went over a railing and into the water around 2pm Wednesday in Brooklyn but completed only two-thirds of a mile of the 1.8-mile waterway. He swam about an hour into the canal in  a stunt to urge environmental clean up that ultimately succumbed to the water's pollution because the experience was like 'swimming 'in a dirty diaper'. Christopher Swain, a clean-water activist, embarked on a 1.8-mile swim in the toxic Gowanus Canal, which has been designated as especially polluted by the Environmental Protection Agency, to urge its cleanup . The swimmer, who quit two-thirds of a mile into the swim, gargled hydrogen peroxide periodically to prevent contaminated water from getting down his throat . Swain, who has previously swam the Hudson and Columbia Rivers, said that cleanup of the Gowanus Canal, which was labelled as a Superfund site by the EPA, should be accelerated . 'It's probably the safest move at this point,' he said, according to Reuters, but pledged to swim the whole canal one day. 'I want to make it clear, no one is telling me to stop,' Swain continued, and said that impending bad weather played a role in his decision. The activist said 'It's not safe to swim in there,' according to Gothamist. He said that the water tasted 'Like mud, poop, ground-up grass, detergent and gasoline'. The 19th-century canal was once a major transportation route, but it's now so polluted with industrial and sewer discharges that it must, by law, be cleaned up. The federal Environmental Protection Agency says contaminates include PCBs, which were banned in the US in 1979. It warned Swain against taking the swim, posting a message on its Twitter account saying that it 'strongly advises AGAINST swimming' in the strip of water. The agency issued guidelines in 2011 saying that people should 'never swim in the canal', which runs over 1½ miles through a narrow industrial zone near increasingly wealthy neighborhoods in Brooklyn. It urged anyone who came in contact with the water to seek medical attention immediately if they felt sick. Crowds gathered on bridges along the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn as Swain was accompanied by a woman in a red kayak . The activist has previously swam the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia River in Washington to bring attention to water issues . Swain waves to the crowds who came to see him swim but were disappointed when he only made it two-thirds of a mile. A baby whale once got lost in the canal in 2007 and died within two days . After heavy rainstorms excess water from the sewer system flows in the canal, where  raw sewage and human excrement that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. An estimated 377million gallons of diluted raw sewage pour into the canal each year. 'There's a lot of poop in there,' Swain said after his swim, according to the New York Post. Dissolved arsenic in the water is thought to be at a level 60 times higher than that harmful to human health. A baby whale became lost in the canal in 2007 and was nicknamed Sludgie by locals. It died in two days. After rainstorms it can often be found with raw sewage that mixes into its normal mix of petroleum products and other chemicals. However Swain, who has previously done long swims along the Hudson River in New York and the Columbia in Washington, wanted to call attention to the slow clean up of the canal and urge for it to be accelerated. An estimated 377million gallons of sewage is poured into the Gowanus Canal every year. Above, trash pollutes the Brooklyn inlet in 2013 . The pollution in the Gowanus Canal combines decades of industrial dumping and general trash. It is particularly filthy after rainstorms . He gargled hydrogen peroxide to fight against any bacteria entering his body and had charcoal tablet to take that will help if he did, according to CityLab. Swain told reporters after he got out that he did not swallow any water. He was accompanied by a woman in a kayak, paddling a few feet away from him before he called it quits. Swain posted on Twitter that swimming in the canal is his 'federal right' under the Clean Water Act of 1972. Gowanus was labeled a Superfund site in 2010, with the EPA later saying that cleaning it up would take up to ten years and $506million, according to DNA Info. Costs will mostly fall on the city and companies that used to be along the canal such as National Grid. The agency plans on beginning dredging in the canal in 2017, which involves cleaning out 600,000 cubic yards of contaminated mud. Before Wednesday's failed effort, Swain also planned on swimming other polluted waters, such as the Bronx River and Newtown Creek, which runs between the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. He said he has hope that New York's polluted waterways will one day be clean enough for swimmers without protective suits. The water advocate claims that it is his 'federal right' to swim in the canal under the Clean Water Act of 1972 .

Paul Armstrong, 26, of Sunderland, flew to Cyprus with four friends before beginning his new role as an IT project manager. But after a spending spree on the trip, Armstrong was stopped at the airport with the stun gun disguised as a torch, extendable baton and knuckle duster stuffed in his luggage. A court heard how the stun gun was capable of administering an electrical discharge which would cause a victim to 'startle and repel'. Armstrong pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm and two offensive weapons and lost his job before he even started it. Judge John Milford QC told Newcastle Crown Court: 'The general public need to be warned about the gravity of bringing home such souvenirs. 'What he did was foolish. It must be realised that the court takes very seriously the bringing into this country of those items. 'A stun gun is, within the legislation of this country, a firearm. It is an extremely serious offence to possess one. 'It is highly undesirable that they should be in circulation in this country.' The 26-year-old was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with £2,000 costs at Newcastle Crown Court (pictured) The judge said a prison sentence was not necessary in Armstrong's case as there was no suggestion he would use the weapons, had never been in trouble before and had recently found employment. Judge Milford added: 'He had an extremely good job lined up. As a consequence of these proceedings, which he had to reveal to his perspective employers, he lost that job.' As such, Armstrong was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with £2,000 costs. Glen Gatland, defending, said; 'He has never been in trouble with the police and is of previous good character. 'He went on holiday to Cyprus with four friends (in the summer of 2013) who had been to primary school together. 'The reason he went was because he had been offered a job as IT project manager with retail branches in London and Zurich. 'He would have been moving away and not able to see his friends.' The court heard three of the friends who had been on the holiday with Armstrong received warnings after batons and knuckle dusters were found in their luggage. Mr Gatland said the weapons were bought from a 'corner shop' in Cyprus and Armstrong had been given the knuckle duster free with his other purchases.","Paul Armstrong flew to Cyprus to celebrate new job as IT project manager .

Speaking about the Terry race row for the first time since leaving his post as England manager, Capello said England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea stalwart at their disposal. ‘I think John is England’s best defender and they have not got a lot of defenders,’ said Capello, ‘It is better to have a player like John than not have him.’ Fabio Capello insists defender John Terry should never have been stripped of the England captaincy . Capello claims England would be in a much stronger position if they still had the Chelsea star at their disposal . The Italian was in charge of the national side when Terry was accused of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand, the brother of then England teammate Rio, during a Chelsea match against QPR in October 2011. He was stripped of his captaincy by the Football Association after being charged by police. Capello resigned as England Manager in February 2012 just two days after publicly criticising the FA’s decision and obviously remains bitter about the whole affair. He believes Terry should have kept his role under the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven. ‘I fought for John to be able to come back and play but they [the Football Association] said “no you can’t decide about the player, you need to wait for the court decision,” and I said “Why?” But they had already decided before I asked. John Terry was caught up in a race controversy with then-QPR defender Anton Ferdinand in 2011 . Chelsea captain Terry, who has 78 England caps, retired from international football in September 2012 . Asked if it was time to persuade Terry, who has been a permanent fixture in the Chelsea side bound for the Premier League title, to come back into the England fold, Capello - speaking at the Laureus World Sports Awards - directed his ire at the FA. ‘You know what happened with me, they decided he could not play with the national team and I didn’t understand because he was not guilty. ‘When it happened I said to the President [David Bernstein] “You decided he’s guilty?” No he’s not guilty, it’s good you can play with the national team and I don’t understand why you don’t play.’ Terry was cleared of racially abusing Ferdinand in a criminal hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court but retired from international football in September 2012 after the FA pursued their own charges. An FA hearing found Terry, who has 78 England caps, guilty of using insulting words which included a reference to Anton Ferdinand’s colour or race and he was banned for four matches and fined £220,000, . Terry, 34, said he was ‘deeply hurt’ by the incident and will never play for England again. Capello agreed his international career was probably over. ‘I don’t think he has the chances to play with the national team more,’ said Capello, ‘But I saw some young players that played with me are improving. [Chris] Smalling is playing and [Phil] Jones. I’m happy because a lot of players I put in the national team are playing now and well.’ The Chelsea defender was cleared in court of racially abusing Ferdinand but was banned and fined by the FA .","Fabio Capello believes England would be much stronger with John Terry .

ad11bc01823390d032d66bcece16293509cf4c45,"(CNN)This is a difficult but necessary thing to say: Incidents of police-involved killings and assaults on unarmed African-Americans are unlikely to end soon. That's partly because police brutality is neither new nor reflective of a ""moment."" And it's also because we have not yet shown the resolve needed to end it. This is a reality we must face if we are going to reverse course from what has become a national crisis. The peaceful protests that were followed by outbreaks of violence in Baltimore this week have underscored the danger of ignoring the crisis -- as frustration and impatience with the status quo boils over. The violent response of police officers to unarmed African-Americans is a decades-long phenomenon that has too often been dismissed as ""race card"" politics and black grievance. But this year's spate of killings and assaults, from Ferguson, Missouri, to North Charleston, South Carolina, to most recently Baltimore, are part of a deadly continuum of conduct that has created a well of resentment and anger in the  African-American community. So what makes now different? The advent of cell phone cameras and social media has for the first time allowed average citizens to document police brutality routinely and to disseminate these images nationally. As a result, it is no longer possible for officials and commentators to downplay or deny the existence of police brutality against unarmed African-Americans as has happened in the past. To call this ugly and unrelenting wave of police violence against unarmed African-Americans a national crisis is not an exaggeration -- we are losing the confidence of a generation of young people who no longer believe in the legitimacy or credibility of our law enforcement and the justice system that underpins it. A true democracy draws its strength from the confidence of its citizens in the bedrock institutions. The loss of that confidence threatens the very foundation of our legal system. How do we face this crisis? First, we must recognize that there are no quick fixes. The culture of policing in cities such as New York and Baltimore has developed over decades. Policing is a job passed down through families in which law enforcement norms and narratives are shared around the dinner table as much as in the station house. To subvert that culture will require vigorous, targeted and consistent training. That training must include a focus on managing implicit bias, encounters with the mentally ill and how best to de-escalate encounters with members of the community, especially young people. Training must be accompanied by supervision and accountability for officers who fail to conform their behavior to training principles. President Barack Obama is right when he reminds us that policing, like education, is a function of state and local government. And it's true that his options are limited. And yet the federal government has proven to be quite adept at influencing education policy in states and cities. How? By conditioning federal funds on compliance with federal standards. In contrast, while the Department of Justice provides more than $1 billion annually in grants to police departments across the country, those funds are provided free from obligations that awardees adopt federal standards on training, data collection or other measures with an explicit anti-racial bias focus. That must change. Also, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department must be properly funded to investigate any police departments suspected of engaging in a pattern and practice of discrimination. Such investigations doubled to more than 20 under Attorney General Eric Holder, but given the nearly 30,000 police departments spread across the country, this is woefully inadequate. It's been reported that nearly every investigation conducted by the department has resulted in a finding of a pattern and practice of discrimination. The results in places such as Seattle and Cincinnati, where the departments worked with local officials to negotiate changes to local police practices, are promising. But the $12 million currently allocated to these investigations nationwide is a shameful pittance. Much has been made of rogue police officers, ""bad apples"" and other aberrant actors in the criminal justice system. They undoubtedly exist. But the failure of local law enforcement leadership to vigorously and aggressively discipline, punish and, where appropriate, remove those officers from police forces around the country has allowed the bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. There must be zero tolerance for racism, brutality and corruption in police departments. Making this change will require law enforcement to value the integrity of the badge over the unquestioning solidarity that has too often resulted in the protection of officers who have committed egregious acts. Yet until police officers come to expect swift and certain punishment for violating their oath to protect and serve, we are unlikely to see a real decrease in incidents of racially motivated police brutality. Ultimately, the crisis we face presents an opportunity to rethink policing in this country fundamentally, including who we decide to recruit to serve. Former Baltimore Police Commissioner Leonard Hamm, for example, has told me he was always skeptical of new police recruits who expressed a desire to become narcotics or homicide detectives. That thinking reflects a spirit of adventure, he told me, rather than a spirit of service. Hamm is right -- policing is, at its core, a service profession. Those we select for this difficult and dangerous job should not only demonstrate mental toughness, courage and smarts, but also integrity, maturity, empathy and a commitment to the communities they serve. A national crisis requires a national response, and that means that federal, state and local law enforcement leaders and organizations must honestly and aggressively move to end police brutality. Until we see that kind of wholesale engagement, the lives of innocent people -- and the integrity of our legal system -- hangs in the balance.","Sherrilyn Ifill: Police violence against unarmed African-Americans is a national crisis .

14b4a869d0faf618c517550b2c0b03647fb3a467,"8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer . Noreen Spendlove was reassured when the results of her latest mammogram were normal. Noreen, then 68, had the scan as part of the NHS breast cancer screening programme, and as she says: 'As always, getting the all-clear was a big relief.' But 18 months later, shortly before her 70th birthday, the mother-of-three from Derbyshire developed intermittent pain in her left side, just below her breast. And although Noreen, a former administrator, wasn't concerned, her daughter, a radiographer, insisted she see a GP. Despite finding nothing abnormal, the GP referred Noreen for a mammogram. This revealed three lumps on her left breast, which were all tumours. Noreen is adamant: 'That GP appointment saved my life.' Breast cancer screening was introduced in 1988, with women aged 50 to 64 invited for a mammogram every three years. In 2000, the upper limit was extended to 70. 'I didn't realise it at the time, but at 68 I'd already had my last official mammogram,' says Noreen. 'It's all the more scary knowing that, because even though I check my breasts regularly, I definitely hadn't felt any lumps. Without my daughter, I wouldn't have gone to my GP.' Noreen was one of the lucky ones. MPs are warning that women will die as a result of the screening age limit. In a report published two weeks ago, the All Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer pointed out that 8,000 women in their 70s are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer. And while more are diagnosed at a younger age - 12,800 in their 60s and 10,600 in their 50s - more than half of the 12,000 women who die from breast cancer every year are over 70. So, extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis for those over 70 and more lives saved, the MPs said. In fact, the upper age limit is due to change. From the end of 2016, all women up to 73 will be invited for screening. But critics argue this is not high enough. Nat Lievesley, a researcher at the Centre for Policy on Ageing, says this cut-off point 'seems arbitrary', adding: 'It feels like a decision based on cost rather than what's best for women.' And the parliamentary group is concerned at the 'slow pace of change'. In 2013, they called for the age limit to be raised to at least 76, and possibly to 79. 'Extending the age for routine mammograms would mean earlier diagnosis and more lives saved' 'While some progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to do in ensuring that older people with breast cancer receive the care, treatment and support most appropriate to them,' says Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester and co-chair of the parliamentary group. And this ageism is not limited to access to mammograms. There's evidence older women are less likely to get certain treatment for breast cancer than younger women. In 2013, researchers at the University of Sussex said women over 70 in the UK who are diagnosed with the disease have only a one-in-seven chance of receiving the chemotherapy that is standard treatment for younger patients. A study from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, published in the British Journal of Cancer, reported that women over 70 are 12 per cent less likely to survive breast cancer after three years than women of the same age in Sweden, where screening in most of the country continues to 74. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, last year warned: 'Around 2,000 deaths from breast cancer in older women could be avoided each year in England if survival rates matched the best in Europe.' It is ‘shameful’ to write off people as too old for screening and treatment, adds Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support. ‘People should be judged on their health as an individual not just their age.’ Ending screening at 73 ‘doesn’t take account of the fact that ageing is changing’, adds Nat Lievesley. ‘It’s no longer a strong indicator of frailty. Just look at the role models for women in their 70s.’ Yet the benefits of extending screening are not clear-cut, for there is a risk of women undergoing unnecessary treatment. A Dutch study, published in the BMJ in August 2014, suggested that inviting all women over the age of 70 for screening could result in 'over- diagnosis and overtreatment'. Researchers monitored 25,500 women aged 70 to 75 diagnosed with the disease after 1995, when breast cancer screening in the Netherlands was extended from 69 to 75. They found this had led to only a small increase in the discovery of advanced breast cancer, while the number of early-stage tumours detected increased considerably. For every woman found to have advanced cancer, another 20 would be diagnosed with small, slow-growing tumours that might not affect their life expectancy but would lead to major surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Lead researcher Dr Gerrit Jan-Liefers, of Leiden University Medical Centre, said: 'The chances of older women recovering from such severe treatment is far less than for younger women.' Older women are more likely to suffer from chronic health problems alongside cancer, he pointed out. 'So it may take them a year, a year and a half before they function normally.' For Noreen Spendlove, however, there is no question in her mind that screening should be extended. After her second mammogram in March 2011, she had a needle biopsy the same day, and two weeks later a mastectomy. The cancer had spread to her neck, so she was given six sessions of chemotherapy followed by a five-week course of radiotherapy. 'The treatment was murderous,' says Noreen. But as she prepares to receive the all-clear next year, she has no regrets about having this treatment. Indeed, her worry is that, once five years since her treatment have passed, she'll no longer be automatically invited back for screening as younger cancer survivors would be. In fact, women are entitled to request mammograms at any age - it's just the invitations that stop. Cancer charities warn that this gives the message that women no longer need to worry about breast cancer. Women are entitled to request mammograms at any age . An added complication is that older women are likely to be less 'breast aware' and more cautious about bothering their GP, the All-Party Parliamentary Group pointed out previously. Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, says: 'It's clear from calls to our helpline many older women believe that because they aren't being invited, they are no longer at risk.' Jackie Woods, 57, a local government officer from Forest Hill, South London, agrees this can be a problem. Her mother, Betty, celebrated her 88th birthday last month after undergoing treatment for breast cancer four years ago. Betty had diligently booked herself in for regular mammograms, despite no longer being invited for screening - but she was rare among her peers in doing so. During November 2011, Jackie was diagnosed with breast cancer after her regular mammogram. The diagnosis reminded Betty to request another scan for herself, and in June 2012 she was diagnosed with an early form of breast cancer and had a mastectomy. Rather than simply ending screening, the Dutch researchers who suggested that extending the programme to all older women could do more harm than good, say the decision whether to continue scans should be personalised to each woman. This should be 'based on remaining life expectancy, breast cancer risk, functional status and patients' preferences', says Dr Jan-Liefers. Another way forward, says Jane Murphy, is for women to be reminded at their last screening that they are entitled to further ones. 'They should be given a card that informs them that they can continue to take advantage of regular screening. But it doesn't always happen.' Noreen Spendlove was given no such card. 'It's terrifying to think that the cancer might not have been picked up,' she says. Breast Cancer Care helpline: 0808 800 6000 or breastcancercare.org.uk.

'Hillary Clinton has gotten so much sh** for her hairstyles over the years,' Julia, who also features on the cover of the supplement, explained. 'Which is remarkable when you consider what it is she does.' Scroll down for video . Strictly business: Julia Louis-Dreyfus covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement @Work, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine . Short and sweet: Julia revealed that the ultra-short hairstyle she models in the newest season of HBO's political comedy Veep (pictured) was inspired by none other than presidential candidate Hillary Clinton . Obsessed with her style: Julia, pictured in an episode from the fourth season of Veep, questioned why so many people have made such a fuss over Hillary's hair during the past few decades . Ever since her husband Bill was elected as US President for the first time in 1993, Hillary's hair has been the subject of serious scrutiny, be it as a result of her choice of scrunchie, the length of her locks, or the shade of her hair. Julia admitted that she is clueless as to why the presidential candidate's hairstyle has been the focus of such intense interest, adding: 'Hair, for some reason, is a really big deal.' And it seems that maintaining her own lengthy locks was certainly a big deal to Julia, who opted to wear a wig while filming the show, instead of chopping her own hair to mirror that of her character. When asked to weigh in on female politicians in general, Julia noted that in her opinion, women in politics appear to be more open than their male counterparts. 'In my limited experience, I would say that female politicians can be a bit more forthcoming, open. I don't mean they're spilling the beans or saying things they shouldn't, but I don't feel a guard in the same way,' she said, adding, 'Maybe it's a female-to-female thing.' Sharp dresser: The 54-year-old actress dons a striped button down and a black pencil skirt in the work-inspired spread . As for her character on the show, Julia explained to the magazine that Selina is a 'straddler' whose ideology revolves around getting 're-elected at all costs'. But the actress has no problem playing an 'unlikable character'. 'I don't think we're all so likable all the time,' she explained. 'I include myself in that, and I don't consider myself to be a bad person.' In the fourth season of the hit show, which premiered on Sunday, Julia's Selina has been promoted from Vice President to President after her boss surprisingly steps down. Big group: The entire Veep cast (pictured) came together earlier this month to celebrate the fourth season premiere of their hit political comedy . Happy couple: Julia's husband, writer and director Brad Hall, showed his support for his wife at the event . And with her change in position, came a change in hair, which Julia also discussed with Page Six, explaining that 'female politicians get a lot of c**p for their looks'. 'There’s a lot of scrutiny about how female politicians present themselves, so I thought, let’s do something about that,' she said. 'Let’s cut her hair and see what happens, and if it doesn't look good, that’s OK, and if it does look good, that’s OK.' Fans of former Seinfeld star Julia are also buzzing about her upcoming reunion with Jerry Seinfeld. On Tuesday it was announced that she would be making an appearance on her former co-star's Crackle channel web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee.","The 54-year-old actress covers Marie Claire's career-oriented supplement, which is featured in the May issue of the magazine ."

Mary, 43, treated her three youngest children, Princess Isabella, seven, and twins Princess Josephine and Prince Vincent, four, to a day out at a farm in Kirke Hyllinge, a village in Zealand. Making the most of the sunny weather, the quartet certainly appeared to be having fun, with all four crouching down to pet a tiny Holstein Friesian calf. Scroll down for video . Enjoying the sunshine: Denmark's Crown Princess Mary and her daughters Isabella and Josephine . Despite the potential for getting dirty, Mary was as fashionable as ever and appeared to have taken inspiration from the rural location in her tweed jacket and jeans. The three children, meanwhile, were well-wrapped up in cosy padded jackets and appeared fascinated by the cows grazing in one of the barns, with Prince Vincent even climbing a fence to get a better look. But not everyone fancied a day out at the farm, with Mary left without her husband Crown Prince Frederik, 46, and eldest son Prince Christian, nine, for the outing. The visit, which was part of Denmark's annual Eco Day celebrations, came days after royals from around Europe descended on Copenhagen for Queen Margrethe II's 75th birthday celebrations.

She also appeared on the balcony of the Amalienborg Palace alongside her husband and children and was there once again for the celebration's climax - a spectacular party at Christiansborg Castle. Although she had stiff competition from the equally glamorous Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden, 37, and Norway's Crown Princess Mette-Marit, 41, the Australian-born royal ensured all eyes were on her courtesy of a shimmering silver gown.

5a2f95702c04f6e4c4ed45c9ec19980004209fc9,"The possession police are out in force, and Jose Mourinho is the Premier League’s Most Wanted. The football purists are foaming at the mouth – how can this Portuguese pretender dare to win games without wanting the football? Is this the most negative side to ever win the title? Is this the most terrible team to lift the Champions’ crown? Woah there, just hang on a moment. Jose Mourinho has come under fire for Chelsea's lack of possession during their 1-0 win over Man United . Mourinho and his staff and players celebrate the crucial win over United on Saturday at Stamford Bridge . I’m no fan of the kind of football Chelsea played on Saturday to beat Manchester United. But at the end of the season, they are getting the job done, it’s as simple as that. And who can blame Mourinho for being so cautious? Last season they were seven points clear at the top of the table but fell away after losing at Aston Villa and Crystal Palace – both in the bottom half of the table at the time, and were beaten at home by Sunderland, who were six points adrift in 20th place. And then needing a win to go top of the Premier League with just two games to go, Mourinho watched his side draw 0-0 at home to Norwich, who were about to be relegated. The title that had been in their grasp, was lost. Chelsea’s most impressive result during that run-in was a 2-0 win at Liverpool, a game made famous by Steven Gerrard’s slip. It ended Liverpool’s 16-match unbeaten run and checked their charge to the title. That day Chelsea let Liverpool have 73 per cent possession over the 90 minutes. Chelsea found a way to win without the ball. And Mourinho did the same on Saturday to an in-form Manchester United, who had 70 per cent possession at Stamford Bridge. It’s not my kind of football – I like to see what talented professional players can do with the ball. And so does Louis van Gaal. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal was left frustrated after his side were defeated 1-0 by Chelsea . Steven Gerrard slips against Chelsea at Anfield last season - a game Chelsea won with only 17% possession . Ba scores as Chelsea go on to win at Anfield and effectively end Liverpool's title push last season . The Dutch master might just wonder to himself if things could have been different if he had certain individuals fit. All clubs have injuries, but for that massive game on Saturday, United needed key players in the team. It would have been fascinating to see if Van Gaal’s possession philosophy would have won the day, over the Jose way. Chelsea won the game, and they did it in typical Mourinho fashion – by not wanting possession of the football. Jose has learned a lot from his mistakes of last season. I understand his pragmatism given that Chelsea are so close to sealing the title. But he fell into this negativity way too early in the season, and it led to their abject failure in Europe. Mourinho needs to be more expansive in the Champions League next season – that’s for sure. Andre Schurrle’s goal against Burnley after a sublime pass from Cesc Fabregas was a highlight of the season . But don’t judge this Chelsea side on the Premier League run-in alone: they may not have been consistently sparkling with their style, but they have had some wonderful moments this season. On day one of the season Cesc Fabregas’ sublime disguised pass for Andre Schurrle’s goal at Burnley had us all out of our seats. It wasn’t his only example of genius since August. When fit, Diego Costa’s strength, movement and finishing have been a joy to watch. And then there’s Eden Hazard. The player Mesut Ozil, Angel di Maria, Samir Nasri and Raheem Sterling and others all dream of being. Yes some of those others have medals, but they haven’t shown the same amazing ability as the Chelsea number 10. His balance, his control, his passing and finishing have all been superb all season. Chelsea forward Eden Hazard (left) dribbles with the ball ahead of Manchester Untied's Wayne Rooney (right) Oscar (second left) scores against Swansea as Chelsea run riot at the Liberty Stadium in January . And during this period when Jose Mourinho is being over-cautious, making sure they secure the title they let slip last season, Hazard has lifted the team from a blue sea of negative mediocrity, to one capable of star quality. And back in January, Chelsea gave arguably the best footballing display of the season in the Premier League when they went to Swansea and won 5-0. The one-touch football was special, and the way the three behind Costa drifted around was reminiscent of the total football played by sides born out of Rinus Michels’ Ajax and Holland sides of the 1970s. Chelsea were 4-0 in front at the break, by which time Willian had also hit the bar twice. Jose’s side completely outplayed and outpassed one of the better footballing sides in the division. So don’t be too harsh on Chelsea, on their way to the title it’s hell to watch them right now. But Mourinho’s men have taken us to heaven enough times this season to keep the critics off their backs.","Jose Mourinho under fire after Chelsea only have 30 per cent possession in Saturday's 1-0 win over Manchester United at Stamford Bridge .

d05f3a2c139515ffd315dadfa420b8be3fc6f6b2,"Two passenger jets allegedly came within 25 seconds of a mid-air collision over the Arabian Sea. One of the carriers involved, Dubai-based Emirates, referred to the apparent near-miss as an 'air traffic control incident' in a statement on Wednesday. Neither the Dubai carrier nor Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways would say how close the two planes came to each other. However a Resolution Advisory (RA) was given to both planes, which means the distance between the two aircraft could have resulted in a collision within 25 seconds. Etihad have maintained that the safety of its passengers was never compromised after it came 'within 25 seconds of collision' with an Emirates plane . The incident occurred on Monday as passenger planes from Emirates and Etihad Airways were traveling in opposite directions between the Gulf and the island nation of Seychelles. Both carriers have recently rerouted flights to the archipelago nation to avoid Yemeni airspace due to fighting there. Emirates says its flight EK709 was returning from the Indian Ocean island nation of Seychelles when the incident occurred  in airspace controlled from Mumbai, India. Etihad Airways separately says it is investigating 'a reported incident' involving one of its planes traveling in the opposite direction. Both carriers insist safety was not compromised. This graphic shows the time in seconds of being at risk of traffic collision for each of the emergency warnings . The incident involving the Etihad Airways and Etihad occurred over the Arabian Sea in Mumbai airspace . Indian news broadcaster NDTV report that there was 'an emergency warning by the planes' on board collision avoidance systems,' and that both pilots reported the incident to Mumbai air traffic controllers. A Traffic Advisory (TA) is sounded to an aircraft when they are within 40 seconds of traffic in a particular airspace. Following this an RA is then given out if an aircraft is at risk of collision within 25 seconds, and the pilot has six seconds to respond. The Seychelles News Agency confirmed both planes received a ‘Resolution Advisory’ or RA, from the on-board Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The incident occurred over the Arabian sea when the two planes were passing each other . An Etihad Airways spokesperson told MailOnline Travel: 'Etihad Airways has strongly rejected claims that the safety of flight EY622, Abu Dhabi to the Seychelles, was compromised. 'The traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), which is fitted on all aircraft, ensured that safe vertical separation of both aircraft was maintained at all times. 'Etihad Airways has provided its safety reports to the GCAA and is assisting with its investigation as well as conducting its own investigation into the incident. 'Safety is Etihad Airways' number one priority.' A statement released by Emirates to the Times of India read: 'Emirates can confirm that flight EK 706 on March 29 from Seychelles to Dubai was involved in an air traffic control incident in Mumbai airspace. At no point was the aircraft, passengers or crew at risk. 'All Emirates aircraft are equipped with onboard instrumentation so that crew are alerted in a timely manner of all surrounding traffic. The crew informed the authorities of the incident and later filed an Air Safety Report, which will be forwarded to Mumbai Air Traffic Control. Safety is of paramount importance to Emirates, and we will be cooperating fully with the Mumbai Air Traffic Control in the subsequent investigation.' Both Etihad Airways and Emirates operate multiple flights every week to the Seychelles . Emirates and Etihad have both grown rapidly in recent years, enticing long-haul transit passengers through their Gulf hubs aboard relatively young aircraft. Emirates is owned by the government of Mideast commercial hub Dubai, while Etihad is controlled by the oil-rich Emirati capital, Abu Dhabi. Both carriers are regulated by the Emirates' General Civil Aviation Authority, which had no immediate comment. They each operate multiple flights weekly to Seychelles, a tropical tourism destination that has built close ties to the Emirates.","Incident occurred over the Arabian Sea in Mumbai Airspace .

e03d3ee4a1ef116db25acd9f8c0ffe2bce7b256e,"Currently showing in cinemas, the new documentary Montage of Heck claims to offer the most intimate glimpse yet into the life of Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. But one Los Angeles resident can offer fans an even more intense taste of the singer's life, by letting them sleep in his house. Cobain lived in this two bedroom apartment on Spaulding Avenue in L.A.'s Fairfax district during the height of Nirvana-mania. Scroll down for video . The two-bedroom apartment is inside a 1920's building on Spaulding Avenue L.A.'s Fairfax district. A picture taken of Kurt Cobain in the early 90s, sitting on the end of the double bed he shared with Courtney Love. And with a parrot resting on his head, of course. The graffiti, however, has long since disappeared . Now its current owner, Brandon Kleinman, 31, has listed it on Airbnb. He wrote on the page advertising it: 'The place is the perfect combination of comfort, style, location and...rock n' roll history. 'Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love lived in the home during the height of Nirvana's musical influence 91-92 to be specific. 'At the time, Kurt was focused on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. 'He (Cobain) was particularly into painting during this time and even decorated the walls in the living room and bedroom.' 'His favourite spot in the house: the bathtub. In it, he wrote the song 'Heart-Shaped Box.' The couple lived in the apartment in 1991 and 1992, just before Frances Bean Cobain was born . It is described as 'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992 . According to Charles R. Cross's 2001 Cobain biography Heavier Than Heaven, the singer and his wife rented the unit for $1,100 (£727) a month. During the time they lived there, Love was pregnant with Frances Bean Cobain, while Cobain was focusing on song writing and his artwork, much of which was created in the apartment. Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for $4,5654 (£3,016) a month, or $1,142 (£754) a week (which works out at about $163/£108 per night). Current guests will have to pay a little more to enjoy the central LA location, with Mr Kleinman offering the apartment for £3016 a month, or £108 a night . Up to three guests can stay in one bedroom of the 1,500-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath flat. One of four homes inside a 1920's building, it offers a large living room with seating, a dining area and a small but fully stocked kitchen. It is described as  'beautiful, decorated and clean' - a far cry from the squalor revealed in photographs taken when Cobain moved out in 1992, which showed graffiti on the walls and rubbish scattering every available surface. The rooms where Cobain stayed have undergone a full renovation since he lived there . Cobain moved out when Love was eight months pregnant after a leak in the bathtub damaged the guitars, music and other possessions he stored there. Since then the place has been fully renovated and much of the idol's artwork has been covered up. Mr Kleinman told Vulture magazine: 'There's latex painting over the fireplace' It's owner suspects art painted by Cobain is hidden under layers of paint on the apartment's walls . 'I know there's tons of art painted on the actual mantel of the fireplace. I want to see if there's a way to get under the layered paint, to see what he painted under there.' 'I tried to get to the original hardwood floor in the hallway, but I can't,' he said. 'It's damaged because the bathtub leaked while Kurt and Courtney lived here. That's why they moved out.' The apartment is located in the middle of LA, five minutes from shopping mecca The Grove .","Cobain lived with Courtney Love in the two bedroom apartment on Spaulding Avenue in L.A.'s Fairfax district .

51c3c466239e3c9f3c319a481d0f81f07c9ea561,"(CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. ""Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,"" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. ""I was frustrated every time I wore it,"" Gordon explains. ""It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character."" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding ""to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit."" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He ""didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it"" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. ""It was a little surprising,"" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that ""everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection."" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it ""cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day."" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to ""squish and compress,"" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with ""polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,"" ¼"" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says ""it can take anything but a gunshot."" The cowl was more problematic, being ""nearly impossible"" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, ""working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape."" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a ""silicone jacket"" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, ""durable and functional"" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. ""People love the theatricality of it,"" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with ""fully adjustable"" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design ""in the next couple of weeks."" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received ""easily over 50 requests from people,"" and not just from the cosplay community.  ""They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit."" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.","21-year-old student Jackson Gordon has designed and built a functional Batsuit .

The raiders were foiled by a brave employee who barricaded the door to the premises, and they proceeded to flee on a motorbike. A passer-by captured photographs of the two criminals, and police have now appealed for the public to help them identify the offenders. Raid: One of two robbers who used a sledgehammer and an axe to try and break in to a jewellery shop . The attempted break-in took place in Pemberton, a suburb of Wigan in Greater Manchester, on Saturday afternoon. One of the raiders used a sledgehammer to smash through an internal wooden door and the other used a axe to smash security glass at Uncle Jewellers and Pawn Brokers. When a worker barricaded the door and pushed one of them back through the broken window they fled the scene, threatening a member of the public with the axe as they did so. Greater Manchester Police are now investigating whether the incident is linked to a similar break-in at another Wigan jeweller last week, which also involved a motorbike and a sledgehammer. Getaway: The two criminals used motorbikes to escape from the scene in Wigan, Greater Manchester . Detective Sergeant Pete Carletti said: 'This attempted robbery happened in broad daylight on a busy Saturday afternoon in Pemberton town centre. 'It caused a lot of commotion and I have no doubt there are lots of potential witnesses who saw what happened and could have vital information for us. 'We have obtained a large number of names of members of the public present in the area at the relevant time but I would ask for those people who have not yet spoken to police to contact us. 'The shop worker showed incredible bravery in the face of adversity to hold these two thieves back and I would like to commend them for their actions. Vehicle: One of the motorcycles used by the raiders, who were caught on camera by a bystander . 'I would also like to thank the member of the public who was brave enough to take photos of the offenders, although we would obviously never advise people to put themselves in danger to do so in any similar situation. 'We now need to find those responsible so I would again urge anyone who witnessed this appalling attempted robbery to come forward.'

The Spanish teacher, who has since lost her job at Hefner Middle School, allegedly planned to invite the boy to spend the night with her as she was house-sitting 'so they could get high and have sex'. Scroll down for video . Charged: Whitney Fetters has been charged with soliciting sex with a minor and  possession of marijuana . Accused: She allegedly exchanged naked photos and sexual videos with the boy, and sent him sexually suggestive text messages. She also invited him over to get high and have sex . She had met the victim at the middle school when he was 12 and the two began sending each other harmless text messages, but last year, the messages became sexual. Court documents cited by News9 earlier this year indicated the victim sent the first sexually explicit message, telling Fetters he thought she was 'hot' with a partially nude photo of the boy. They allegedly went on to exchange 20 naked and partially nude images, as well as videos of themselves performing sex acts and explicit Snapchat messages. One text allegedly sent by Fetters to the boy read, 'Touching myself is fun', WSET reported. Another featured a photo of the woman wearing only her underwear with a text: 'That's all you get.' The teacher allegedly planned to invite the boy over to stay the night so they could have sex on February 13, but authorities learned of the relationship before that was able to happen. The plan emerged after other students told school staff that the boy had inappropriate photos of a woman,The Oklahoman reported. Caught: Fetters first started messaging the boy when he was 12 and the texts turned sexual last year . Fired: The 28-year-old Spanish teacher was fired after students told staff that the boy had photos of her . Officials learned of the allegations against the middle school teacher on January 30. When two school principals approached him during a school sporting event, he allegedly deleted the explicit photos and videos, but police were able to recover them. During a search of Fetters' family home, police seized her cell phone, computers, marijuana, and lingerie matching the photos found on the student's iPad. She was removed from her job and no longer works for the school district. Fetters graduated from the University of Central Oklahoma with a BA in Spanish. According to public records, she is not married.","Whitney Fetters turned herself into cops in February after it emerged she 'had exchanged X-rated photos and videos with the student'

The 20-month-old boy had reportedly been choking and struggling to breathe on March the 23rd and was rushed to Coolah District Hospital by emergency services where he was pronounced dead. Forensic officers attended the property on Merrygoen Rd in Neilrex on Wednesday where they executed a crime scene warrant. The death of a 20-month-old toddler is being treated as suspicious after he was admitted struggling to breathe . Police strongly believe that there are members of the Neilrex community, which is 60 kilometres south of Coonabarabran, that can help them with their investigation. According to the ABC, police have said that inquiries to date suggest the death was suspicious. Detective Inspector Cameron Whiteside said it was not the time to speculate or develop theories. 'This is a very serious matter...this is the death of a young child, a toddler,' he said. 'However I can tell you because of the nature of the information we received, the examination of the crime scene and the medical examination that's taken place in relation to the child, the investigation is being regarded as suspicious,' he told the Seven Network. The infant was rushed to Coolah District Hospital by emergency services but sadly died shortly after . Police are treating the incident as suspicious and executed a crime scene warrant on Wednesday . Detective Whiteside has also said that the child's parents have been spoken to and they are in ongoing contact with them in relation to the investigation. 'Remembering this is the death of a 20-month-old child who didn't get the opportunity to reach his second birthday,' he said. Officers are appealing to the public for any information about the incident.","The death of a toddler two weeks ago is being treated as suspicious .

From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases. A recent study of four major discount retailers  in the United States by the Ecology Centre found that 133 out of 164 products tested, including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws, contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern'. From bargain bath mats and kitchen utensils to fun knick-knacks like silly straws and children’s stick-on jewellery, hundreds of products sold at discount retailers have been found to contain toxic levels of harmful metals, plastics and chemicals that have been linked to cancers and diseases (stock picture) Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies, Nicole Bijlsma, told Daily Mail Australia that an investigation into products sold at Australian two dollar stores could produce similar results. Australian author and CEO of the Australian College of Environmental Studies Nicole Bijlsma said the chemicals in these products are easily absorbed through ingestion and skin . 'Based on the amount of products that have been recalled over the years and studies which have found the levels of industrial chemicals are rising in younger generations, there's definitely a history to indicate that they [products at discount stores] could contain chemicals that cause adverse health affect,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'It depends on the type of chemical, but a lot of these things are absorbed through ingestion and dermal exposure. Kids have a very high hand to mouth ratio and are putting things in their mouth all the time.' A set of children's necklaces examined by the study were found to have high levels of bromine, chlorine and lead. Bromine is known to permanently affect developing brains and present reproduction problems in those exposed to it, while studies have found that chlorine causes cancer as well as thyroid and kidney disease. Meanwhile, scientists have found that even the smallest amount of lead can affect a child's ability to learn. Dozens of other products were also listed as having harmful chemicals, including silly straws which were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates which have been linked to birth defects, reduced fertility, cancer, learning disabilities, diabetes, and other health issues, according to the report. She said that a recent study of four major discount retailers in the United States, which found 133 out of 164 products tested contained at least one hazardous chemical 'above levels of concern', would find similar results in Australia . Additional harmful substances found in the products included polyvinyl chloride plastic (also known as PVC or vinyl) and packaging chemical bisphenol-A (also known as BPA). 1. Buy Australian made products: They are subject to rigorous regulations and Australian manufactures are not permitted to use harmful chemicals. 2. Go back to basics: Use glass and stainless steel to store food instead of plastics. 3. Less is best: If it’s not edible, it won’t be good for your skin either, as it absorbs whatever is put on it. 4. Try the natural approach against pests first: Instead of pest sprays, install fly screens and ensure no food is around before reaching for chemicals. 5. Leave your shoes outside: take them off before you go inside and trek dust and pesticides from outside into your home . Ms Bijlsma, a building biologist, who assess people's homes - including measuring chemicals in their water, air, building materials and household products - to see what's making them sick, said that while discount stores were the focus of negative attention, harmful chemicals can be found in any product which is manufactured outside of Australia. 'About 90 per cent or more of our products, including footwear, clothing and furnishings, aren't actually manufactured in Australia. They're manufactured in Asia and imported products are not regulated in the same way as they are here and that's where the problem lies,' Ms Bijlsma said. 'To use a safer alternative would cost more money and sometimes it's just easier for company's not to bother doing research - why would they? In Australia they don't have to prove that the chemicals they are using are not harmful. 'BPA is a good example because people got wind that it was affecting children's behaviour and had an increased risk of breast cancer - so the manufacturer changed it and replaced it with bisphenol-S which has shown to be worse. A non-slip bath tub mat was found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) 'It's about generating profits for industry and so they get cheap products in, but they neglect safety standards. 'It's possible because regulators don't ask for a certificate of analysis to prove there are no banned industrial chemicals  in the product and just assume that what the manufacturer overseas says is accurate.' A spokesman for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Daily Mail Australia that while 'there is always a possibility that some products on the market might not meet accepted standards of safety' the 'chance is very small'. It assured that the ACCC had an active chemical inspection program and that the products supplied to discount variety stores are 'often included in analytical surveys and surveillance activities conducted by the ACCC' and other product safety regulators. However they also put great emphasis on Australian Consumer Laws which require suppliers to 'ensure their products are safe and suitable for their intended purpose', saying: 'most suppliers have systems in place to source safe products.' Stock image: Children's stick-on earnings sold at the stores were found to contain high levels of bromine and chlorine and medium levels of tin . Latex coated gloves were found to have high levels of chlorine and medium levels of antimony while silly straws were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates (stock pictures) Ms Bijlsma said not enough was being done by the ACCC, which she said only completes occasional spot checks, with thousands of shipping containers going unchecked. 'The system is based on just doing spot checks here and there, but it doesn't happen with every product,' she said. 'We have a mismatch of five or six organisations in Australia that are involved in chemical and manufacturing regulation and they are under-resourced, understaffed and it takes them years to regulate a chemical. 'The way chemicals are regulated here is primarily through self-regulation: it's based on a reactive approach system where if you have had a significant health complaint from a consumer, you are obliged to pass it on. 'Then they [regulators] list it as a ""priority chemical"", see what other countries do and talk to other organisations, and write a recommendation report - this takes years. Extensions chords were found to have high levels of chlorine and phthalates while plastic spoons were found to have low levels of chlorine and tin (stock pictures) 'That's not adequate to protect our families' safety. It's not good enough. The system needs to change and the burden of proof needs to be on the manufacturer to prove the product is safe before it's released on the market.' The ACCC stated that products found to be unsafe are removed from the market or recalled by suppliers and that any company that fails to comply with standards faces a fine of up to $1.1 million. But part of the problem lies in the average Australian's trust that anything being sold to them on a supermarket shelf is tested, according to Ms Bijlsma. 'Consumers assume someone is regulating chemicals and that's where the problem lies. In reality, even 80 - 90 per cent of all the chemicals in household products like cleaning products and personal care products, have never been tested for harmful chemicals,' she said.","Over 100 items including children's jewellery, floor mats, kitchen utensils and silly straws contained either harmful plastics, metals or chemicals .

A 30-year-old mother-of-two allegedly high on bath salts stabbed her family dog with a kitchen knife because she thought it was possessed by demons, according to police in Maine. Aroostook County Sheriff's Office responded to a home in Perham on Sunday and found Ashley Doody acting aggressively and exhibiting unpredictable behavior. They discovered that Doody, who is a nurse, had attacked her mixed-breed dog, Trixie. The sheriff says the dog lost a lot of blood but was taken to a veterinarian and is expected to survive - while Doody is in jail on $1,000 bail. She has been charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and is due to appear before Aroostock County Superior Court on May 19. According to deputies, when they arrived at the home, Doody was threatening to harm herself with the knife. They discovered that she had stabbed Trixie believing the dog was 'demon possessed.' Police have said that they believe Doody had taken bath salts which can cause severe agitation, paranoia, hallucinations and suicidal behavior in users. State animal welfare agents have been notified of the attack and already Doody has been banned from any access to pets in the future. According to her Facebook page, Doody is engaged to be married to Mark Sawyer and has been since May 2008.

Stacey Eden, 23, stood up for the Muslim woman and her partner after witnessing the ranter 'bullying' the Sydney commuter on an Airport Line train around 1:40pm on Wednesday afternoon. Ms Eden switched on the video camera on her mobile phone to record the vile rant before rushing to Muslim couple's defence with a fiery spray notably absent any swearing. A police spokeswoman contacted Daily Mail Australia on Thursday to say they would 'definitely encourage' witnesses of the incident to come forward. In her recording of the incident, Ms Eden is heard fuming:  'She wears it (her hijab) for herself, OK!' 'She wears it because she wants to be modest with her body, not because of people like you who are going to sit there and disrespect her.' Ms Eden said she became really upset after the woman allegedly branded 'all Muslims ISIS supporters' and insulted the woman's husband and headscarf. Scroll down for video . Not going to take it anymore: Stacey Eden (pictured) made a bold stand in defence of a Muslim couple who faced a racially-charged tirade on a Sydney train on Wednesday afternoon . Rant: Video shows this woman launching into a fiery spray about Islam, bringing up beheadings and the marriage of children while berating a Muslim woman for wearing a black headscarf . Ms Eden, who recorded a snippet of the conversation, fired back at the woman in defence of the Muslim couple (above): 'Have some respect... What's that got to do with this poor lady?' Ms Eden was not having a bar of it. 'That is not her doing it. That is a minority of people. Not a majority of people OK? 'It doesn't matter what they're doing... Have some respect, have some respect,' she said, as the woman continued on her tirade. 'It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. What's that got to do with this poor lady? What's that got to do with her?' 'She was saying some pretty horrible and hurtful things before I spoke up then as soon I started defending them she stopped' The Muslim couple told Stacey Eden (left, right) that they were 'very grateful' for her stand . 'Nothing,' the ranter replied. 'Exactly!' Ms Eden fired back. 'You're the one who started the argument!' the woman said. Ms Eden then instructed the woman to be silent. 'No, you're the one sitting there saying things under your breath, shut your mouth, simple. 'You shut your mouth,' the woman replied. 'No, you shut your mouth. You've got nothing nice to say, don't say anything, simple.' Ms Eden recorded a short snippet of the incident - not the whole alleged tirade - on her phone, ending with the passenger telling her to 'breathe'. She told Daily Mail Australia the Muslim couple and the angry woman alighted the train at Sydney International Airport.

The Muslim couple were 'very grateful' for her stand, she said. Police and Sydney Trains have not yet received any reports of the incident. The Islamophobia Register Australia group issued a statement praising Ms Eden's actions shortly after Daily Mail Australia's report. 'We are heartened by Stacey's actions - she is a reflection of 'Team Humanity' and we hope that her actions inspire others to stand up against racial or religious vilification,' it said. The group said they were disappointed by the remarks of the woman in the video. 'The sentiments expressed by the woman however sadly form part of the broader false and deeply damaging narrative whereby the criminal actions of groups like Daesh [Islamic State] are extrapolated to all 1.5+ billion Muslims'. The group's founder, Mariam Veiszadeh, told Daily Mail Australia incidents of abuse against Muslim women were becoming increasingly common. ''I'm very conscious of ensuring that I have sufficient storage space on my phone to ensure I will be able to record incidents should I either be the victim in an incident (or a witness),' she said.

36b4a34bf0dddf129480d3fe1759a959cbe11118,"Everton will look to extend Darron Gibson's contract this summer as he recovers from the latest injury setback of his career. Roberto Martinez confirmed on Thursday that the Republic of Ireland international will miss the final seven games of the season with metatarsal damage, but expects him to be ready for pre-season as he does not require surgery. Gibson has endured a wretched time over the last 18 months, not least when he ruptured cruciate ligaments, and his position at Goodison Park could be regarded as vulnerable, particularly as Everton will rekindle their long-standing interest in Tom Cleverley in the summer. Everton midfielder Darron Gibson will not play again this season after damaging his metatarsal . Everton manager Roberto Martinez expects Gibson to return to pre-season in the best possible shape . Cleverley, who has spent the season on loan at Aston Villa, will become a free agent in July when his Manchester United contract expires and, given they have worked together before at Wigan, he is a player Martinez will consider recruiting. But Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans. The 27-year-old was signed by David Moyes in January 2012 and has 12 months remaining on his current deal but his manager is already looking at his situation. 'This injury has arrived at such a bad moment because he was back from another long-term injury but it's something we'll look at in the summer,' said Martinez. 'I've been very pleased with Darron. Coming back from that sort of injury you don't reach 100 per cent for a long time. Everton will look to extend Gibson's contract this summer as he is treated for his latest injury setback . Martinez has moved to assure Gibson he has a place in his plans despite holding an interest in Tom Cleverley . 'But when he's been on the pitch, he's performed really well. From the Leicester game, all his performances have been really influential. Though he's now injured, he's been able to show his worth and for me he is an important player that we want here for the future. 'We are going to see him. But I'm not too worried. It is a tricky injury because if you don't heal it properly, it could come back. We need to make sure he is 100 per cent. If he is fully fit for pre-season, that would be fantastic. We don't have another player like him in the squad. 'We are trying to support him. He can add that calm feeling, he has shown his worth and what he is capable of adding. But it is tough, I won't lie. It is devastating for him. We just have to look at the positive that he doesn't need surgery. At one point, it looked very likely.' Cleverley is a target of Martinez and with his Manchester United contract running out a move could happen . Cleverley played under Martinez at Wigan, on loan from United, and has been at Villa Park this season . Having won their last three matches against Newcastle, QPR and Southampton, Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League for more than 12 months to clamber away from a potential relegation scrap. There is no chance, however, of them qualifying for Europe next season but Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings in the summer has been effected. He feels the club's progress over the last four years means they are strong enough to withstand this disappointment. Everton have put together their best sequence of results in the Barclays Premier League in over a year . Martinez does not think their potential to make new signings has been effected by a lack of European football . 'Within football when you face an opposition losing or winning doesn't affect players,' said Martinez. 'It's how you lose and I think every player who's faced Everton this season will have come out with a real respect and a real appreciation of the way we play as a club. 'We don't rely on 10 months of results, we've got a bigger picture of what we're trying to achieve and what we've got in the squad, particularly in terms of the younger players who have been given incredible roles. So I think the perception of Everton has improved in the last 12 months. 'We know the positions that we need to strengthen in the summer. It's something we've worked really hard on since January in order to identify those targets but a lot of decisions will depend on how we perform in the last seven games. It's going to be a very important end of season for us.' Martinez says he has 'got a bigger picture' of Everton's progress and does not rely on 10 months of results .","Darron Gibson has been ruled out for the rest of the season with injury .

The 60-year-old, whose daughter is a former X-Factor contestant, sent a text to a relative shortly before the crash on August 20 last year saying: 'I'm in a plane out of control and it's going down.' An investigation by the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) said the message was 'unusual' as the leased plane did not enter a spin until after it was sent. The experienced pilot had also tried to call the same relative before writing 148 characters within 25 seconds in a text - something the AAIB said would require 'considerable dexterity'. The report said: 'The pilot had accumulated considerable experience in a variety of aircraft in the years that he had been flying. He was familiar with the Piper Tomahawk aircraft and was in recent flying practice. 'It was suggested in his final text message that he had lost control of the aircraft, to such an extent that he did not expect to survive. 'However, after this message was sent, the aircraft continued in flight for more than two minutes, before entering a spin from which it did not recover.' Investigators found no fault with the aircraft and said weather conditions were unlikely to have caused the crash. Mr Naviede, of Regent's Park, London, had previously undertaken aerobatic training, meaning he 'would have recognised, and been able to recover from, a spin', according to the AAIB. The investigation also revealed the father-of-two had not booked a final destination for the fatal flight. Mr Naviede, whose personal wealth was once estimated to be £117million, was the former head of trade finance company Arrows, which collapsed owing more than £100 million to overseas banks and other creditors in 1991. He was the father of model and 2007 X-Factor contestant Raquelle Gracie, who was in girl band Hope, and had a record with Pharrell Williams. The girls initially auditioned for the fourth series as solo artists but judge Louis Walsh told them to re-audition as a band and they made it to the live shows where they came fifth. His Piper Tomahawk aircraft plummeted into a field near Padbury in Buckinghamshire in August last year . The pilot had written a 148 character text within 25 seconds - something the Air Accident Investigation Branch said would require 'considerable dexterity especially in an aircraft that may have been out of control' Ms Gracie, who is married with an 18-month-old daughter, is now a yoga teacher and continues to sing after previously hosting an online news and gossip series on website Dipdive, created by will.i.am. His brother was the former Government race advisor Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004. In 1995, a jury at the Old Bailey convicted him of seven charges of fraudulent trading, obtaining property and services by deception and making false statements to obtain bank facilities. On the day of the crash, Mr Naviede had flown the Piper PA-38 Tomahawk from Elstree, Hertfordshire, to Turweston Aerodrome before heading on to White Waltham airfield near Maidenhead, Berkshire. He was then due to return to Elstree, but at 4.55pm Mr Naviede telephoned the aerodrome to say he would not be returning that day and did not book an alternative destination. The plane took off from White Waltham shortly after 5pm, heading north, and when he was just south of Buckingham, he began to fly in a circle for almost an hour at between 2,500ft and 4,700ft. His daughter Raquelle Gracie (far right) came fifth in the 2007 series of the X Factor with girl band Hope . It was at this time he made a number of calls on his mobile telephone and at 6.31pm he unsuccessfully tried to call the relative who he then sent the final text to. Investigators suggested that two minutes later he still had 'at least control of lateral flight'. The aircraft then turned to the left as the pilot sent out a 'Mayday' distress call, saying: 'Lost control of the aircraft and it's gone into a spin.' Mr Naviede then confirmed his location to the controller before saying: 'I can't control it.' Mr Naviede's brother was former Government race advisor, Nighat Awan, who entertained Mrs Blair at her multi-million pound home in Cheshire in 2004 . The AAIB report said: 'It was apparent, from the witness accounts and the on-site evidence, that the aircraft had entered a spin from which it did not recover. 'The time elapsed during the pilot's final radio transmissions, together with the rate of descent deduced from the NASA videos, suggested that the spin was likely to have started from a minimum height of 2,500ft, and probably higher.' The report also highlighted strange aspects of Mr Naviede's behaviour on the day, although people who spoke to him said he appeared 'chatty, friendly and relaxed'. Investigators wrote: 'There were a number of events which took place in the course of the afternoon which represented unusual actions on the part of the pilot. 'It appears the pilot made a change of intended destination prior to leaving White Waltham. 'Having booked out for Elstree he subsequently called them to advise he would not be returning there. He did not book out to any other destination. 'After departing White Waltham and flying north for about half an hour, he flew in a large circular pattern for almost an hour. 'Although somewhat unusual, this may be explained by the need to re-charge the aircraft battery.' Mr Naviede, who had more than 3,000 hours of flying experience, died instantly in the crash and a post-mortem examination carried out on his body revealed he died as a result of multiple injuries. A date has not been set for an inquest but it is likely to take place in May with a jury.","Muhammad Naviede died after his Piper Tomahawk aircraft crashed in field .

879e8cfb61b654aaff814b537fbe448fdc19c1e7,"(CNN)Two Transportation Security Administration screeners have been fired after conspiring to grope attractive men at Denver International Airport, Denver police said. Here's how police say the scheme worked: When the male TSA officer noticed a man he found attractive, he would alert a female TSA officer. The female officer would then tell the screening machine that a female passenger -- not a male -- was walking through. And that information would trigger a machine to register an anomaly in the groin area, prompting the male TSA officer to pat down the passenger, police said, citing a TSA investigation. But during the patdown, the male TSA officer used the palms of his hands to touch the passenger's front groin area and buttocks, which violates TSA policy. Former TSA agent sentenced for recording coworker . All this came to light after an anonymous tip from a TSA employee in November. The agency launched an investigation, and investigator Chris Higgins monitored the two TSA officers in question, Denver police said in a report. Higgins watched the plan being carried out on February 9. He interviewed the female TSA officer, who said she had done this with her colleague at least 10 other times, police said. Both of the TSA officers investigated have been fired, TSA special agent Charles Stone told police. Authorities did not release their names. Giant security gap at airports: Lack of criminal background checks . The TSA called the incident deplorable. ""These alleged acts are egregious and intolerable,"" the agency said in a written statement to CNN. ""All allegations of misconduct are thoroughly investigated by the agency. And when substantiated, employees are held accountable."" But it's unlikely criminal charges will be filed because there is no identifiable victim. The TSA said it has been trying to identify the passenger in the February incident but to no avail. The TSA said no passengers have come forward with similar cases so far at the Denver airport. Hidden cameras reveal airport workers stealing from luggage . CNN's Tony Marco contributed to this report.","Police: A male TSA officer signaled to a female officer when he found a man attractive .

665b2ccb4b6acdb325885c8c035df13607444558,"Smartly dressed in a bowler hat and waistcoat, these civilians may look like respectable members of society in Edwardian England. In fact, they were the drunkards banned from every boozer in Birmingham for a string of crimes including drink-driving a steam engine, riding a horse while drunk and being intoxicated to the point of 'complete incompetence'. They were all placed on the 1904 blacklist after four convictions under the Inebriates Act of 1898. The list was then sent to landlords who were not allowed to sell them alcohol. Scroll down for video . Boozy: Kitted out in a bowler hat and waistcoat, he may appear to be a right-thinking member of Edwardian England, but Matthew Moran was banned from every pub in Birmingham at the turn of the century . Black listed: Alice Tatlow was also banned from every Birmingham boozer for being 'drunk and disorderly'; publicans were told they could recognise her by a tattoo of the Prince of Wales's feathers . Barred: 46-year-old Mary Bayliss was one of the many respectable-looking women barred from drinking in Birmingham after being found drunk and disorderly . On the blacklist, each drunkard’s entry includes photographs, their name, alias, residence, employment, physical description, distinguishing marks, nature of conviction and the sentence received for booze-related crimes. Offenders who were caught drunk and disorderly were ordered to work up to 21 days of 'hard labour' in comparison to today's fixed penalty or fine. They form part of the UK Midlands Collection, which covers a 400 year period and contains more than 21 million records detailing the good, the bad and the famous who have shaped the history of the city. Unearthed by Ancestry, the world's largest online family history resource, the records are available for all to see. Ladette: Elizabeth Thompson was a 29-year-old prostitute when she was arrested for drunkenness and sentenced to two weeks' hard labour . Rowdy: Charwoman Susannah Booton was arrested for drunken behaviour in February 1906 . Criminal: Each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal, as well as a description of their nose and face; Annie Hodgkins was said to have a 'fresh complexion' despite being sentenced to three weeks' hard labour . Poster: Unemployed Kate Kibble, another woman convicted of being drunk and disorderly, was described as having a 'broad' build, as well as losing her right eye and having 'both little fingers crooked' Some of the bizarre offences committed by past Birmingham residents include theft of a dead duck and riding a horse while drunk. Nearly 10,000 Edwardian felons are listed in the UK Midlands criminal registers providing fascinating insight into the murky underworld of Birmingham's metropolis more than a century ago. Among those on the blacklist are Henry Bonus, 40, who was sentenced to a year's hard labour and three months' police supervision after stealing eight pounds of ham. Elsewhere, 18-year-old William Handley was sentenced to eight months' hard labour and one-year's police supervision for stealing a 'dead duck' and a teapot. Careers: Sarah Henson combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute, before being banned from pubs for being drunk and disorderly . Haggard: Just 38, Eliza Fallon looked a lot older than her years when she was arrested for drunkenness . Distinctive: Sarah Evans, left, and Ellen Heaton, right, could be recognised by their scars, according to the Birmingham archives . Records reveal how offenders came from a variety of backgrounds, such as metal cutters, grease merchants, labourers and hawkers. Many had aliases - suggesting criminal careers - while others had scars or physical handicaps, ranging from Kate Kibble's one eye to cut marks on faces, broken noses and missing fingers. Some, however, lived perfectly respectable lives - until they walked through the door of their local watering hole. It shows how those living in Edwardian England were just as likely to get half-cut and troublesome on a night out as boozy Brits in today's binge drinking culture.","Archives reveal list of drunkards banned from every pub in Birmingham .

b335401d4c5db42440f1b39ce6bc89a5a9682a93,"Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain. 'I think John Kerry tried to come back and sell a bill of goods, hoping maybe that the Iranians wouldn’t say much about it,' the Republican lawmaker told radio host Hugh Hewitt during his Thursday program. McCain, responding to the supreme leader of Iran's proclamation yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way.' Launching a rare attack from his official White House Twitter account, President Barack Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest in turn said it was 'naïve and reckless' for McCain 'to believe every word of the Supreme Leader's political speech.' 'He shouldn't,' Earnest added. And the president's deputy national security adviser told reporters traveling with the administration abroad that it's 'very clear and understood that sanctions relief will be phased.' Secretary of State John Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions as part of a nuclear deal when they didn't and get away with it, says the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John McCain . Kerry, is flanked here by President Barack Obama and National Security Adviser Susan Rice at the bilateral meeting between President Obama and Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela today in Panama City, Panama. The Obama administration is in Panama to attend the VII Summit of the Americas . 'The fact of the matter is, we have framework,' Rhodes said, according to the Associate Press. 'The president has said if the details don't bear out, we won't have a deal.' Obama, Kerry, National Security Adviser Susan Rice and other members of the president's kitchen cabinet are in Panama for the Summit of the Americas. Backed into a corner by reporters, the White House on Monday indicated that negotiators left Switzerland last week without coming to an agreement about the pace at which sanctions would be removed. The administration had stated in a fact sheet that nuclear-related sanctions would be 'suspended' if Iran complied with the terms of the deal. The president said in a live statement they would be 'phased' out over time. The framework, however, he said would remain in place so sanctions could be snapped back into place if need be. Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, immediately cast a cloud over the United State's assertions, pointing out that the statement released by the United States' negotiating partners made no reference to either the gradual lifting of sanctions. Zarif indicated that his country was under the interpretation was that sanctions would be 'terminated.' Asked the next day about Zarif's claims, the lead spokeswoman for the State Department shrugged them off and said she wasn't too concerned with how Iranian leaders sold the deal in their own country. Barraged with questions at his Monday briefing about who was lying - the U.S. or Iran - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest suggested that the timing of sanctions relief remained a topic of discussion - a major revelation given the dispute's potential for derailing a written agreement. Khamenei reaffirmed on Thursday his country's vow not to sign an agreement unless negotiators kowtow to Iran's demands and promise the 'instant annulment of all sanction,' according to a translation. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani similarly said, 'We will not sign any agreement, unless all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the first day of the implementation of the deal.' Khamenei further stated Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring.' 'Foreign monitoring on #Iran's security isn’t allowed,' he said on Twitter. Speaking to reporters in Panama today, Rhodes also dismissed Iranian officials' rhetoric about the agreement as spin. 'They have their own hardliners who are skeptical of this deal,' he said. 'The test of whether or not that framework can be memorialized is not a comment on any given day by an Iranian leader, the test will be if by the end of June we have a document.' Responding to the supreme leader of Iran's announcement yesterday that there would be no formal pact unless sanctions relief is 'instant,' McCain, above, said he had 'sympathy' for Iranian Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, because Kerry 'must have known' what the perimeters were for a long-term accord 'and yet chose to interpret it in another way' McCain ripped into former colleague Kerry on Hewitt's radio show for mischaracterizing preliminary talks with Iran. 'It’s probably in black and white that the Ayatollah is probably right,' McCain said. 'John Kerry is delusional.' Continuing, the Arizona senator said, 'I think you’re going to find out that they had never agreed to the things that John Kerry claimed that they had.' 'So in a way, I can’t blame the Ayatollah, because I don’t think they ever agreed to it.' Republican Senator Mark Kirk on Thursday said, 'It’s increasingly clear that Iran, in fact, failed to reach agreement with the United States and its partners on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement. 'At best, Iran agreed to disagree with the United States on key nuclear weapons-related issues and to continue talks,' the Illinois lawmaker said. McCain told Hewitt Kerry's behavior 'reveals that a number of things' about his 'negotiating capabilities and also his candor with the American people.' He also said he believes Senate Republicans are 'extremely close' to winning enough Democrats' support to push through a veto-proof bill giving Congress the power to review the formal deal with Iran that is scheduled to materialize by June 30. Khamenei further stated that Iran would not allow an 'unconventional inspection or monitoring' Even with out that legislation, McCain claimed that the Senate has the Constitutional authority to reject an accord because it is technically treaty. Obama should 'read the Constitution of the United States,' McCain said. This is clearly a treaty.' And even if the president 'disregards the Constitution' McCain said - 'which he certainly did with executive orders concerning immigration' - Congress should have a say in an issue of this scale. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, a member of the Armed Services Committee who is exploring a presidential run, said in a statement Friday afternoon that 'the Ayatollah and President Obama appear to be talking about two separate agreements. 'Unfortunately, I can’t say I’m surprised,' he added. 'President Obama wants a deal way too badly, and his Administration has been trying to sell a deal which may not actually exist.' Graham said the Obama administration should tell Iran 'in no uncertain terms – that should we come to an actual agreement between both parties, sanctions relief will not be immediate.' 'Any realistic agreement must preclude sanctions relief from being granted until Iran proves it has ended its military nuclear program.' Drawing on Khamenei's comment about supervision, Graham said he would 'never' lend his support to a deal that doesn't allow for inspections 'anytime and anywhere.' With 'Iran’s history of cheating,' he said, 'it would be incredibly dangerous not to require Iran to abide by an ‘anytime-anywhere’ inspections regime.'","Kerry 'is delusional' if he expected to claim the Iranians agreed to the phased lifting of sanctions when they didn't and get away with it, he said .

The latest to open in the capital this week is the Oshun Café, which will serve £6 bowls of Brazilian superfood acai berries. The sparse menu offers four variations of berry bowls, served with different toppings and fruit accompaniments. The Native Acai Berry Bowl is topped with bananas, granola, raisin and honey .

Liane Holey, founder of the cafe said: ‘Brazil’s streets are filled with vendors blending acaí pulp with fresh bananas and then topped with honey and granola to create an innocuously addictive berry bowl. ‘Oshun Cafe wants the UK to celebrate this way of eating acaí, not as powder, dried supplements or in smoothies and pasteurised juices which have significantly smaller amounts of Açaí and preserved nutrients.” The acaí berry is a rich purple fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, the small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazonian people. The Acai Berry Bowl Cafe will serve four types of berry bowls. The cafe is open from seven days a week . Oshun Maya with cinnamon, raw cacao, orange and avocado with nested popcorn . The berries taste like blueberries and dark chocolate, with a distinctly earthy aftertaste. They are a favourite of celebrities such as Victoria Beckham, Oprah Winfrey and Matthew McConaughey. Due to their high level of antioxidants the berries are considered a superfood.They also contain high levels of manganese and Omega and are renowned for their weight loss qualities. Oshun Native - acaí pulp, banana and honey. Oshun Tang: courgette, lime, sour cherries and acai pulp . Oshun Kong: banana, lemongrass, ginger, coriander and honey. Oshun Maya: acai berries, raw cacao, cinnamon, orange and avocado . Speaking about the potent powder, food blogger and nutritionist Deliciously Ella said: 'Acai is unbelievably rich in antioxidants, with one of the highest levels ever tested (eight times that of blueberries and 10 to 30 times that of red wine,) as well as vitamin E and omega-3s, all of which work to stop free radical damage and keep your body. 'It’s also amazing for keeping your skin glowing and slowing down the signs of ageing.' The large seed from each berry is removed and the remaining Açaí pulp (along with its nutrients) is frozen within 24 hours of being harvested, due to the fresh berry’s short lifespan. In Brazil, acai berry bowls are eaten around the clock. Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open in Soho, London in May . Cashing in on the trend for single-item menu restaurants, Melt Room, which only serves toasties - or 'melts' as they are known - will open its doors in May.

Nik Williamson of The Porridge Cafe . The menu is currently being finalised but there will approximately be four breakfast toasties or 'melts' as they will be called, and six signature melts . The 12-seater cafe will also serve seasonal specials and 'hero melts' with unique cheeses. Melt Room follows on the heels of Old Street's Porridge Cafe, Simply Crispy in Belfast which serves crisp sandwiches and Brick Lane's Cereal Killer Cafe . The Porridge Cafe - from the founders of The Bow Street Kitchen Nik Wiliamson and Elly Harrington - opened in early March and serves 25 types of porridge made from 11 different grains. Prices range from £2.35 for a bowl of basic porridge to £7 for the more hearty versions, with meat and vegetable toppings. The cafe serves both sweet and savoury versions of the traditional breakfast dish. In December 2014 self-confessed cereal obsessives Alan and Gary Keery launched the UK’s first cereal cafe featuring 120 cereals, 20 types of toppings and 12 varieties of milk. The identical twins’ establishment opened in Brick Lane, London and offers a menu of over 100 cereals from around the world. The duo came under fire when they first opened their cafe, for charging £3.20 for a bowl of cereal. The single-item cafe movement is not just confined to London. Belfast's Simply Crispy which opened earlier in January was the brainchild of businessman Andrew McMenamin who had planned to keep his pop-up going for just four weeks.

The acai berry is a rich purple palm fruit indigenous to the Amazon rainforest. For hundreds of years, these small dark berries have been integral to the diet of native Amazon people. The berries are packed with amino acids, as well as vitamins A, B, C and E and minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper and zinc. The fruit perishes quickly after being picked, so to help preserve its goodness it is often made into acai berry juice, supplements or powder, which is often whizzed into a smoothie. According to some sites selling acai products, the berry's fibre and essential fatty acid content contribute to its ability to burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly, cut down on cravings, and boost metabolism.","Oshun Cafe serves four variations of Brazilian superfood, costing £6 each .

This season, like so many in recent years, has been a frustrating one at St James' Park and that has led some fans to take action when Spurs arrive on Sunday. A number of supporters plan to boycott the televised game in protest against owner Mike Ashley, which is likely to lead to a peculiar atmosphere in the north east. Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino (right) is in an upbeat mood ahead of the trip to Newcastle . Newcastle fans are staging a mass protest against the current regime at St James' Park . It will certainly make it an interesting test for Pochettino's side as they look to recover from some disappointing recent results of their own. 'You never know because sometimes the effect on the players and team maybe is positive,' the Spurs boss said. 'Maybe sometimes the players are scared and run more than all season. 'Or maybe it is a very negative atmosphere and they feel under pressure and don't show their face. 'You never know in football how it can affect all the decisions around the team. For that it is difficult to guess what will happen on Sunday.' On paper, this looks a good opportunity for Spurs to make amends for the goalless draw at Burnley and home defeat to Aston Villa. Christian Benteke scored the winner for Aston Villa to leave Spurs' season in danger of fizzling out . The fact Pochettino's predecessor Tim Sherwood oversaw the latter's victory made it all the more frustrating, yet the Spurs boss was in a surprisingly upbeat mood ahead of the trip to St James' Park. 'I think that football is football and I am a person who has spent all my life in football as player, manager and head coach,' he said. 'I accept in football there are good and bad moments, but one thing important is to keep your balance and a good mood. 'We always want to win and we are ambitious, but always we need to have a very good mood. 'We need to have patience, we need to work hard, we have to have our minds on the players and we need to have very good energy to repeat some of the performances this season.'

Once the animals are done in the ring, they'll be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida. Some of the Asian Elephants will live out their post-performance lives in the center, while other will be used for breeding. Scroll down for video . All elephants will be phased out of the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus performance by 2018 . Once they retire from performing, elephants will be taken to the Ringling Brothers Elephant Conservation Center in an undisclosed, 200-acre area of Polk County in central Florida . Ringling spokeswoman Melinda Hartline told FOX Tampa Bay that the center is 'all about preserving the Asian Elephant'. Elephants born in the center can be sold to zoos or other breeding programs. This will hopefully increase genetic diversity in the species and increase its population. The population of animal has decreased to between 25,000 and 32,000 from it's 100,000 population over the last century. Poaching and habitat destruction are among the reasons for the decline. Twenty people work at the center to feed, care for and manage the animals, and over the next three years Ringling will determine if more staff or additional facilities are needed. Despite having what seems to be ideal living conditions, Ringling ties some elephants by the leg overnight, something animal rights groups, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) are disappointed by. Some elephants will live out the rest of their lives in the conservation center, while others will be use for breeding . A spokesman for the center said that the organization's goal is to conserve the Asian Elephant, an animal who has seen massive population decline over the last century . Much of the population decline - which has gone down from 100,000 to between 25,000 and 32,000 - has been caused by poaching and habitat destruction . 'Zoos don't chain elephants and the American Veterinary Medical Association advises against it' Delciana Windners, PETA general counsel, told FOX. The animal-rights organizations also urge the company to take the animals off the road sooner. Just days before announcing that the elephants would be taken out of the ring, PETA prevailed in an open-records request and obtained documents proving that, at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis. TB is highly transmissible from elephants to humans, even without direct contact. A statement from PETA frames Ringling’s announcement as a preemptive move to keep the public in the dark about the health risk posed by moving sick elephants to cities throughout the country. 'These elephants suffer greatly, but now their retirement is vital to everyone’s safety,' the statement read. Animal rights groups, including PETA, have said that Ringling Brothers should take elephants out of their shows before 2018 . PETA released information earlier this year stating that at least since 2010, Ringling has had elephants test positive for the human strain of tuberculosis .","Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus announced that it will no longer have elephants in the show starting in 2018 .

3be4f31cd94e867338e4a27496818d31e9486d49,"On trial: Former Ukip MEP Ashley Mote (pictured arriving at London's Southwark Crown Court today) is accused of a string of fraud-related offences . A former Ukip MEP fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in European Parliament expenses - using some of it to fund his domestic court battles, a court heard today. Ashley Mote, 79, of Binsted, Hampshire, is accused of a string of fraud-related offences including acquiring criminal property and obtaining a money transfer by deception. Some of the money he allegedly made from the fraud went towards funding various legal costs he had built up as a result of being prosecuted in the UK for benefit fraud offences, a jury at London's Southwark Crown Court was told. He denies 11 offences alleged to have taken place between November 2004 and July 2010. Jonathan Davies, prosecuting, said that as an MEP, Mote could claim expenses, including a Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, or Secretarial Allowance, to help fund his work. Mr Davies said: ‘What the prosecution say happened between 2004 and 2009, when Mr Mote ceased to be an MEP, is that he abused that allowance by submitting false claims for payment for work which he said to the European Parliament had been done by organisations working on his behalf.’ Jurors heard that two of the organisations had previously campaigned against UK membership of the European Union. They were the Better Off Out Fund (Boof), and Direct Action Resistance To Tyranny (Dartt). However, it is alleged that neither of these companies conducted any work for Mote, who made claims of £16,000 against Boof, and £54,000 to Dartt. ‘They were simply used as a front to perpetrate, carry out fraud and to receive monies from the European Parliament,’ said Mr Davies. European Parliament in Brussels: Prosecutors claim Mote was 'using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud' Mote is also said to have falsely claimed £5,000 a month for work he claimed had been carried out by Estonia based company Icos (Information Centrum Owned State). It is alleged that he even set up a Danish bank account under the similar name of ‘Information Centrim OS’ for funds from the European Parliament to be paid into, ‘dishonestly obtaining’ approximately €355,000. Giving details of Mote carrying out fraud to fund his rising legal bills, Mr Davies said: ‘He asked for payments to be made to the firm of solicitors on the basis that they were providing him with advice in relation to his duties as an MEP. ‘In fact the money was being used to fund a number of criminal and civil proceedings related to Mr Mote's prosecution for benefit fraud offences, and indeed some unrelated civil proceedings. ‘Basically we say he was using European Parliament money to fund his defence and various appeals in connection with being prosecuted for benefit fraud.’ Mr Davies continued: ‘This was a sophisticated fraud committed over several years during which Mr Mote made a number of false representations and produced a number of false documents in order to deceive the European Parliament into believing that significant amounts of work were being done on his behalf, relating to his work as an MEP. Pleading not guilty: Mote (pictured again today) allegedly fraudulently claimed almost £500,000 in expenses . ‘In total he dishonestly obtained approximately €355,000 and £184,000 of allowances to which he was not entitled. It's not quite half a million pounds, but it's not far short.’ Jurors heard that while MEPs were allowed to make certain legitimate claims for expenses from the European Parliament, they were not supposed to use this money to enrich themselves. Between 2004, when he was elected MEP and 2009, Mote claimed a total of £750,000 in Parliamentary Assistance Allowance, taking into account his legitimate claims and any alleged fraudulent activity. Mote was elected a Ukip MEP for South East England in 2004, but shortly before he actually took up his seat was thrown out of Nigel Farage's party because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud. However, he sat as an independent MEP until 2009, when he decided not to stand for election. The court heard that in April 2004 Mote's case for alleged income support, council tax and housing benefit fraud was sent to crown court to be dealt with, and he was elected as an MEP two months later. Elected as MEP: Mote (pictured in 2006) was thrown out of Ukip because he was being prosecuted by the Department for Work and Pensions for benefit fraud . But he made an application to the court saying that the criminal proceedings against him were a breach of his rights to free movement, as his bail conditions meant he could not travel freely to Europe. The courts agreed with this and proceedings against Mote were stayed, prompting the prosecution to make an application to the Attorney General to review the matter. Jurors heard that in light of this, Mote wrote to the manager of European Parliament allowances asking for expenses to allow him to fight this. He wrote: ‘I have to fund myself in the legal affairs committee against an attempt by the British government to unseat me as an MEP. This is going to incur legal costs.’ However, Mr Davies told the court that Mote did not disclose that he was being prosecuted for fraud. He said: ‘What Mr Mote doesn't say is something along the lines of “I am being prosecuted for fraud arising out of events prior to being elected as an MEP”.’ Jurors heard that the Attorney General overturned the decision and Mote was prosecuted and convicted of benefit fraud in August 2007. Mote denies four counts of obtaining a money transfer by deception, three of false accounting, two of fraud, and one each of acquiring criminal property and concealing criminal property. The trial resumes at 10am tomorrow when the opening will continue.

2d896bc51bc066ffe6148f13a43bd779ccebdb4b,"A mayoral candidate has bungee jumped from a bridge where his ancestor plummeted 160ft to his death for a drunken bet worth just a sixpence. Dave Roberts, who is in the running to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, followed in his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister's footsteps by leaping off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees. However, instead of falling to his death like his relative did more than 100 years ago - Mr Roberts survived the jump which he carried out for a children's charity. Dave Roberts, who hopes to become the mayor of Middlesbrough, has bungee jumped off the Transporter Bridge over the River Tees 100 years after his ancestor jumped to his death for a bet worth just a sixpence . Mr Roberts, a 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, said 'Daniel, this one's for you' as he jumped off the bridge - in reference to his great-great-uncle Daniel McAllister who died after leaping off the bridge in 1913 . The 50-year-old former TV and radio presenter, from Marton, Middlesbrough, said: 'I thought it was going to be sheer terror, but I actually really enjoyed it. 'I had a good moment just before the jump. The guy was saying, I am going to count to three, and then you are going to jump. 'I said, I need to speak to my relative. I said: ""Daniel, this one's for you. I am going to collect your winnings"". 'I screamed like a child as I was going down, but thoroughly enjoyed it.' Mr McAllister was challenged to jump off the bridge by a friend after drinking in a pub in Port Clarence in a bet worth a sixpence. He died on May 4, 1913 at the age of 30. Newspaper articles from 1913 about Mr McAllister's death (pictured) tell how he 'dived to his death' and drowned following an 'amazing act of bravado' The cause of death was listed as: 'Shock and suffocation from drowning through jumping from the Transporter Bridge in a spirit of bravado whilst under the influence of drink.' Father-of-two Mr Roberts, who grew up listening to stories about his ancestor, managed to track down Mr McAllister's death certificate, which listed him as a general labourer of Washington Street in Middlesbrough. Mr Roberts, who was handed a sixpence and a beer after his jump this week, said: 'A century after Daniel was killed, and in a bid to exorcise the ghost of my ancestor, I decided I would have a go at the jump as well. 'But I wanted to do it as a charity event, and make sure I was safely attached to a bungee rope! 'The Daniel McAllister story has been in the family for over a century. 'No one really believed it to be true as all attempts to link it to the 1913 bridge jump had failed due to searching the wrong line of the family tree. 'Then we found a 1899 marriage certificate of Daniel's sister Emily, which opened a new route and this finally provided the link we needed.' Mr Roberts, who lives with his wife Francesca, 45, and children Kari, 14, and Luke 12, is running for mayor having moved back to England from a job in Singapore 18 months ago where he was vice president of business development for Fox TV. He said: 'This was all fun and games but I am a serious mayoral candidate for the town who has a great sense of humour and I'll be making a lot of serious points in the run-up to the election as I am a Middlesbrough lad who cares deeply about his town. 'Normally town mayors get set for the high jump after their term in office, this one got out of the way before the hard work starts.' He asked Teesside residents to stump up £2.50 - roughly what a sixpence would be worth today - to support him and raise money for the MFC Foundation which helps children in need.

f7e0de384a8e52cafaa3161f71a979d269fe12fe,"(CNN)The Tulsa County reserve deputy who fatally shot a man instead of using his Taser turned himself in to authorities Tuesday at the Tulsa County Jail. Video shows Reserve Deputy Robert Bates announcing he is going to deploy his Taser after an undercover weapons sting on April 2 but then shooting Eric Courtney Harris in the back with a handgun. Bates was charged with second-degree manslaughter Monday. He surrendered Tuesday morning, accompanied by his attorney, Clark Brewster, and immediately posted bail of $25,000. As he exited the jailhouse, Bates paused in front of television cameras for a moment but did not speak. His attorney reiterated that he believes the charge against his client is unwarranted. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office says a sting operation caught Harris illegally selling a gun. Harris ran when officers came in for the arrest. Authorities say Bates thought he pulled out his Taser but ""inadvertently"" fired his gun. Harris' brother, Andre Harris, told CNN that he is pleased District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler pressed charges. In his opinion, however, no type of force should have been used in the arrest of his brother. Watching the video of the shooting, Andre Harris said he can see that three or more officers were already on top of his brother. That manpower should have been enough to arrest him, he said. ""It was a situation where I didn't necessarily think that a Taser should even be used,"" Andre Harris said. Scott Wood, another Bates' attorney, has said the shooting was an ""excusable homicide."" Investigators' efforts to defend Bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online. Harris' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality. They're also questioning why the 73-year-old Bates -- the CEO of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation. Daniel Smolen, an attorney representing the Harris family, said Bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time. Bates, who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s, had been a reserve deputy since 2008, with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience, according to the sheriff's office. He was also a frequent contributor to the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office, including $2,500 to the re-election of Sheriff Stanley Glanz. The sheriff's office has said that Bates had law enforcement certification, but Smolen said he has not seen any field training records. ""We're holding up all right at this point,"" Andre Harris said. ""We're putting our faith in God that justice will be served, and we can get some closure in this situation."" How easy is it to confuse a gun for a Taser? In a statement released Tuesday, Eric Harris' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in Tulsa County. ""However, the treatment of Eric of April 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the TCSO,"" the statement said. The family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies. CNN's Jason Morris and Ed Lavandera contributed to this report.","Reserve Deputy Robert Bates surrenders to authorities, posts bail of $25,000 .

8ad87b83c0033077d7bfe8a13d5507126330dde0,"Patterns appearing on both the very large and very small scale are rare in nature. But researchers have found such a pattern in two apparently unrelated places - cells in human skin, and the mysterious fairy circles in Namibia. While the distribution of desert fairy circles may look random, as if the landscape is marked with freckles, the pattern closely matches the distribution pattern of skin cells. Researchers have found a similar pattern in two apparently unrelated places - skin cells and the mysterious fairy circles in the Namibian desert. The illustration on the left shows the distribution of skin cells, and the one on the right plots fairy circles, which are also arranged in polygons . ‘It's a completely amazing, strange match,’ said Professor Robert Sinclair, head of the Mathematical Biology Unit at Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST) in Japan. Desert fairy circles are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because no one knows how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth measuring anywhere between 10ft and 65ft in diameter (three metres to 20 metres) that are ringed by short grass dotting the scrub land like craters on the moon, or big freckles. Several teams of scientists are trying to explain the bizarre markings, and suggestions have included termites nibbling grass, zebras rolling in circles, competition for resources, hydrocarbons emanating from the depths of the earth to kill off patches of vegetation and even aliens. Desert fairy circles (pictured) are considered one of nature's greatest mysteries because it is now known how they form. Found in Namibia, they are large barren patches of earth ringed by short grass dotting the desert like craters on the moon, or big freckles . Now, Professor Sinclair and Haozhe Zhang believe they have identified a small, but vital, piece of the puzzle by comparing their distribution to skin cells. The duo compared the number of 'neighbours' adjacent to fairy circles and skin cells, according to the study published in Ecological Complexity. They used satellite images of fairy circles and a computer to draw lines halfway between each pair to give them invisible boundaries that look similar to cell walls. The majority of skin cells and fairy circles both had six 'neighbours', and similar percentages of other neighbours (shown in this graph) The computer then counted how many neighbours surrounded each fairy circle. Another group of researchers had calculated skin cell neighbours in a similar way several years ago, which was used as a comparison. The experts found that the results were almost identical, in that both the majority of skin cells and fairy circles had six neighbours. And the percentage of fairy circles with four, five, six, seven, eight and nine neighbours was essentially the same as the skin cells. ‘I didn't expect it to be so close,’ Professor Sinclair said. ‘We spent a lot of time checking because it really looked too close to believe.’ Mr Zhang, a PhD student at Iowa State University who was previously at OISTsaid that future mathematical models designed to explain how fairy rings are made should incorporate the results of this study. The researchers suspect the patterns might be similar because both skin cells and fairy circles are fighting for space. Professor Sinclair said: ‘It is still difficult to say why exactly they are similar, but the fact that they are similar is already very important. ‘This is suggesting there may be such types of patterns that cover really different size scales.’ Huge swathes of grassland in Namibia is covered with mysterious vegetation-free patches that have been baffling scientists for decades. While a number of studies have suggested the fairy circles are created by industrious termites, research last May claimed they are the result of resource competition for water among plants. German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles and found that they are ‘remarkably regular’ in their distribution, which made them question the termite theory. Experts from various institutions have previously claimed that termites nibble away at grassroots in certain grasslands of southwest Africa, causing the dieback of vegetation and creating a water trap. Last year, German researchers analysed the spatial distribution of the fairy circles (pictured in the Marienfluss Valley) and found that they are 'remarkably regular' in their distribution. There is a no vegetation growth within the circular area . The genesis of a fairy circle has not been observed. Their occurrence appears to be restricted to particularly arid zones at the border of grassland and desert regions, according to the study published in the journal Ecography, where there is intense resource-competition for water. Dr Getzin's team was joined by experts from Göttingen in Germany, Italy and Israel who studied aerial images of the circles in north west Namibia to pinpoint the location and distribution of the barren patches within the surrounding landscape. Using statistical methods, they found that the circles are distributed regularly across large areas. ‘The occurrence of such patterning in nature is rather unusual. There must be particularly strong regulating forces at work,’ Dr Getzin said. He believes it is the local resource-competition among plants and vegetation, in a similar way to how young trees space themselves out in forests to ensure they have access to enough nutrients and water. ‘A similar process of resource-competition may consequently also be the real cause for a self-organising formation of the mysterious fairy circle patterns,’ the study says. The scientists simulated underground competition for water and the spatial vegetation distribution patterns. They found that similar patterns emerged on the screen to those recorded in Namibia.","It is not known how fairy circles in the Namibian desert are made .

ad1fd9bc7aaa1652edc615d6bd42bed5066aff95,"Detectives probing the murders of a Playboy bunny and a 16-year-old schoolgirl 40 years ago have offered a £40,000 reward in a bid to bring their killer to justice. Eve Stratford, a 22-year-old glamour model who worked at London's Playboy club, was found with her throat slashed in her Leyton home on the evening of 18 March 1975. Six months later, Lynne Weedon, 16, was  attacked and raped in an alleyway near her home in Hounslow at 11pm on September 3, as she returned from a night out with friends. She was found abandoned and barely alive at an electricity sub-station the next morning and died a week later. Eve Stratford, 22, a Playboy bunny, was stabbed between eight and 12 times when she was murdered on the evening of 18 March 1975 . Both murders were linked in July 2006 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims, who did not know each other. It appears the motive was sexual - Lynne had been raped, and it is likely Eve had also been raped although detectives haven't been able to rule out consensual sex. The reward was posted last night as detectives appealed for information, which could lead to the identification, arrest and prosecution of those responsible, on BBC's Crimewatch show. Lynne's mother, Margaret Weedon, described the murder 40 years ago as a 'true life sentence' for the family. Lynne Weedon (right) was beaten over the head with a blunt object. Detectives believes Lynda Farrow (left), who was knifed to death in 1979, was also a victim of the same killer . She said: 'We have missed out on so much; she missed out on life, no relationship or marriage, no career or children or even just travelling the world, all taken from her. 'We are left 40 years on always wondering what it would have been like. 'We are well aware that whoever murdered Lynne also murdered Eve Stratford. That young lady also had her life snubbed out. Her family have died now. Another true life sentence. 'The hurt eases but the pain still sits deep somewhere inside. There are so many questions. So many thoughts. So much heartache. 'I will make a mother's plea for anyone who can tell us some information about the person who took my daughter and Eve Stratford's lives to come forward. Please, please give us some sort of closure.' Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh from Scotland Yard  said he was hopeful the killer had let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend or even a cellmate or medical professional. He said it is likely the suspect for both murders is now in his 60s or 70s. The glamour model was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times . Police believe Lynne was followed on foot from Great Western Road into The Short Hedges (pictured right), before she was hit with a blunt instrument - her body was thrown over the fence and she was left for dead . Mr McHugh said detectives are keeping an open mind but have previously said it is possible the killer knew his victims, particularly Eve who had a huge circle of friends and acquaintances. He added: 'It's inconceivable the killer of Eve and Lynne has kept the perfect secret for 40 years. 18 March 1975: Playboy bunny Eve Stratford found  with her throat slashed at her home. 3 September 1975: Lynne Weedon, 16, was attacked and raped in an alleyway  at 11pm. 10 September 1975: Schoolgirl died in hospital from her injuries. July 2006: Murders linked in 2007 after matching DNA was discovered on the victims. March 2015: Police launched fresh appeal on the 40th anniversary of their deaths. April 2015: Detectives offer £40,000 reward for information about killings. 'It's a heavy burden to carry and he must have let details slip over the years - maybe to a partner, a friend, even a cellmate - and I would appeal to anyone with information to contact us.' Mr McHugh appealed in particular to mental health professionals and prison officers who may have received disclosures from a patient or prisoner. Former Met Police detective Colin Sutton believes a third woman, Lynda Farrow - who was knifed to death in her home four years later in 1979 - was also a victim of the same killer. Miss Stratford worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966. She was 22 when she was killed in her home and police said her throat had been slashed between eight and 12 times. Detectives believe she may have known her killer and invited him into the flat she shared with her boyfriend Tony Priest, the lead singer with the pop band Onyx, who found her body. Miss Stratford (left) worked as a bunny girl at the Playboy Club in London's Park Lane, which was the height of decadence when it opened in 1966 . This map shows the three unsolved murders all took place in close proximity - it is believed they are all linked . She was found dead in the bedroom of her flat at 5.30pm with a nylon stocking tied around one ankle and a scarf binding her hands behind her back. An hour earlier a neighbour had heard a male and female voice talking, apparently calmly, in her flat. There was no sign of forced entry. A blood-splattered bouquet of flowers she had bought earlier that day lay next to her body. She was last seen walking alone near her home in Lyndhurst Drive, Leyton, shortly before 4pm on a snowy day in March. Later that year Lynne was beaten over the head with a blunt object as she took a short-cut to her home in Hounslow. She was then thrown over a fence into the grounds of an electricity sub-station before being raped and left for dead. A school caretaker looking after the grounds found her still alive and she was taken to West Middlesex Hospital where she died a week later. The post-mortem examination found her skull was smashed with a heavy blunt instrument, but the weapon was never recovered. Anyone with information is asked to call the incident room on 020 8785 8099 or, to remain anonymous, call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

In an emotional outburst during a concert Bobby appeared close to tears as he referenced his daughter's ongoing battle for her life.​ . ​The former husband of Whitney Houston looked tired and grief stricken at times during his performance, his first public appearance since Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. Bobby Brown spoke for the first time about daughter Bobbi Kristina in Los Angeles on Saturday night and admitted: 'I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with ​it' The one-time boy band star shied away from talking in detail about his daughter but instead admitted these were 'rough times.' However, in an odd moment during his 45-minute set, he took time out to promote his kine of BBQ sauces. Bobby performed a set of his old hits for 4,000 fans at the Soul Food Festival ​in downtown Los Angeles ​on Saturday after months staying by his daughter Bobbi Kristina's side. Unresponsive: On January 31, Bobbi Kristina Brown was found unresponsive in her bathtub. She's been in a coma ever since . The 46-year-old was given the biggest cheer of the night as he took to the stage to play hits like Don't Be Cruel and ​On Our Own. ​After his drawn-out introduction Bobby, looking tired from performing dance moves, choked up as he said: 'I must ​tell y'all. This feels really, ​really really good. 'I want to thank all of y'all for coming out tonight​ to support me and my family. ​'Rough times are rough times, hard times are hard times I dunno what the hell ​I am going through right now, but I am giving it to God and letting him deal with it.' ​Panting and sounding frustrated: '​There is only one thing I ask of you all tonight and that is enjoy yourselves.' Smiling he added: 'Don't be cruel, come on,' referring to one of his biggest hits​ the 80s. ​After a few other tunes, Bobby needed a break from the stage to rest while his boyband performed a number. Bobby needed a towel to wipe his face and often looked out of breath as he relived dance moves from his glory days. Later he was a little less emotional as fans cheered his performances of hits like Roni and Rock Witcha. Broke his silence: The former boy bander's appearance was booked before Bobbi Kristina fell into a coma. It was also Brown's first time discussing the matter in public . Had a booth: Brown told the LA crowd, 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff to my new album to my new Edition to Heads Of States and I have been working on my food line; actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth' Looking toward his stand where his Bobby Brown BBQ cooking tent was set up at the festival, he told the crowd: 'Listen I have been doing a lot of things and been working on a lot of projects from Real Husbands Of Hollywood to my own stuff, to my new album, to my new Edition to Heads Of States, and I have been working on my food line. Actually you all can get some food right there, in my booth. ​'​I will over there in a little bit​ later, if you want to buy some barb​e​cue sauce, seasonings, chicken and a couple of sausages. I don'​t know what my wife is cooking ​- whatever it, is is good. You have got to get the season​ing​, because the seasoning is off the chain, I must let you know.' ​Bobby then asked a bandmate to talk about another brand, but fired back: 'Mine is much better, low in sodium content​, low in salt for us folk if, you understand what I ​am saying. ​'So I made this for us.' Wiping away sweat from his face, he added: 'I ain't done with it yet. I got marinades and all kind of s*** coming out.' He then corrected himself: 'Excuse my French baby girl. I didn't mean to curse in front of you. And ladies too.' He then introduced his new ​R&B​ boy band band 'who can saanng.' 'You just listen and tell me if you like it.' Back to work: Brown's pregnant wife Alicia Etheredge was also at the food festival, selling Bobby Brown's BBQ sauce . Timing: The singer and barbecue entrepreneur was committed to the event before his daughter was hospitalized. He's also slated for a tour of Australia . ​Bobby's appearance marks his first time away from Bobbi in months. He had been scheduled to make the appearance before his daughter's accident. Bobbi remains hospitalized and in a coma after being found unconscious and face-down in a bathtub on January 31. The Soul Food Festival is among a string of appearances Bobby is contractually obligated to fulfill/ The singer is also scheduled to leave daughter Bobbi to tour in Australia. Even though he doesn't want to go, the promoters are holding the distraught father to his contractual obligation, TMZ reports. Bobbi Kristina remains on life support in a long-term care center in Atlanta, Georgia, after being treated at the city's Emory University Hospital where the ex-husband of Whitney Houston visits her regularly. Reportedly Bobby has the final say as to whether the young woman's support system is turned off. ​At the Festival 90s rap act Salt'N'Pepa had the crowd on their feet with their performance of Push It.","Broke down during Los Angeles concert as he talked about his daughter Bobbi Kristin, who has been in a coma since January 31 .

e944dba22ff1ad03fce3783cddb879fe67251b7b,"A celebrated Texas-born hunter was crushed to death by a baby elephant in Zimbabwe as he tried to measure its ivory tusks for an American client. Ian Gibson, 55, was a lauded figure among U.S. safari enthusiasts, who would commission him to slaughter prized animals near his home in South Africa. On Wednesday, he was tentatively approaching the young bull elephant in Zimbabwe's Zambezi Valley when the animal charged, and knelt on Gibson until he died. Crushed to death: Ian Gibson, 55, was killed by a young bull elephant while measuring its ivory for a U.S. client . His American client, who was also present, has not been identified. The Dallas Safari Club is paying for Gibson's funeral. Despite only having one leg, Gibson was described by fans as 'fit and strong'. According to a statement from Safari Classics, posted on AfricaHunting.com, the group had stopped for a rest when the animal approached their group. Gibson and his tracker approached to assess its ivory. 'At very close range, Ian was able to get off one shot before the bull killed him. The scene was very graphic,' the statement read. Twitter users were widely pitiless, with hundreds of animal rights supporters commenting that he 'got what he deserved'. Lauded figure: Gibson, who lived in South Africa, was a popular figure in the U.S. safari enthusiast community . Backlash: Twitter users have been widely unsympathetic to Gibson's death in Zimbabwe on Wednesday . Tributes posted on the hunting forum slammed unsympathetic reactions to Gibson's death, describing the big game hunter as a 'magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist.' According to friends, he fired one shot at the young bull elephant, who was going through 'musth' - a period of high testosterone. The animal then charged. Gibson's trackers wrote on AfricaHunting.com: 'We know 'Gibbo' shot it once, from about 10 yards away, with a 458 [rifle]. 'He would never have fired unless he had no alternative. He was a hunter, yes, but he was also a magnificent wildlife photographer and conservationist. Prized: Ivory tusks are some of the most prized treasures hunters can get, enraging animal rights supporters . 'He was so experienced and this is a most unexpected tragedy.' The news has come a month after a study was released warning that ivory hunting is continuing to diminish the elephant population in Africa. A report by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, which is known as CITES and regulates wildlife trade, said poaching rates of elephants in areas that are being monitored still exceed their natural birth rates. Conservationists say tens of thousands of elephants have been killed in Africa in recent years as demand for ivory in Asia, particularly China, increases. Past estimates of Africa's elephant population have ranged from 420,000 to 650,000. Prince William is one of the world's most prominent voices in defense of elephants against ivory hunters.","Ian Gibson, 55, was hunting in Zimbabwe for an American client .

39f02f3b87a6b1be687baf36d00bd72683eaa155,"Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which includes the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, as well as honouring Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. The seven-year-old came across the fossils at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile when he and his sister, Macarena were looking for decorative stones. They were playing at the site because their geologist parents, Manuel Suarez and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes mountain range. Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. However, more than a dozen specimens have now been excavated, including four skeletons, which demonstrate that the dinosaur combined a variety of unique anatomical traits. The dinosaur has been likened to a platypus, which is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom, because it's one of very few mammal to lay eggs, has venomous spurs and a paddle-shaped tail like a beaver, as well as webbed feet and a bill like a duck, among other idiosyncrasies. Most of the specimens discovered are the size of a turkey, but some isolated bones reveal the maximum size of Chilesaurus was around 10 feet (three metres) long, according to Chilean and Argentinian palaeontologists from institutions including the University of Birmingham who have studied the skeletons. Unusual: Fossils dating from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, reveal an unusual combination of features from various dinosaur groups, including relatively short arms, a long neck, small head and leaf-shaped teeth (pictured) Bizarre: Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics including its small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The dinosaur itself, has a lengthy neck and must have had good balance (illustrated) Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics. The Late Jurassic dinosaur lived 145 million years ago. It has a small skull and feet, which are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus, but has two blunt fingers instead of sharp claws, like the Velociraptor, for example. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon. It has leaf-shaped teeth, similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs. Most unusually, the animal was a vegetarian, despite belonging the theopod family of dinosaurs, which were mostly fierce meat eaters. The dinosaur ranged in size from as small as a turkey to 10 ft (three metres) long. They discovered that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod the Velociraptor. Chilesaurus' pelvic girdle resembles that of the ornithischian dinosaurs - beaked, herbivorous dinosaurs such as stegosaurs and Iguanadon - whereas it is actually classified in the other basic dinosaur division – Saurischia, according to the study published in the journal Nature. The different parts of the body of Chilesaurus were adapted to a particular diet and way of life, which was similar to other groups of dinosaurs. As a result of these habits, different regions of the body of Chilesaurus evolved resembling those present in other, unrelated groups of dinosaurs - a phenomenon called evolutionary convergence. Chilesaurus represents one of the most extreme cases of evolutionary convergence. For example, its leaf-shaped teeth are similar to those of primitive long-neck dinosaurs because they were selected over millions of years as a result of a similar diet between these two lineages of dinosaurs. 'Chilesaurus can be considered a ""platypus"" dinosaur because different parts of its body resemble those of other dinosaur groups due to mosaic convergent evolution,’ Martín Ezcurra, a researcher at the University of Birmingham explained. Painstaking: Close inspection of the fossils revealed that Chilesaurus has robust forelimbs similar to Jurassic theropods such as Allosaurus. But its hands have two blunt fingers, instead of sharp claws like its fellow theropod, the Velociraptor. The process of excavating the skeleton is shown . The presence of herbivorous theropods was, up until now, only known in close relatives of birds but Chilesaurus (illustrated left) shows that a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than thought. Its fossils were found at the Toqui Formation in southern Chile, marked with a red star on the map, right . ‘In this process, a region or regions of an organism resemble others of unrelated species because of a similar mode of life and evolutionary pressures. ‘Chilesaurus provides a good example of how evolution works in deep time and it is one of the most interesting cases of convergent evolution documented in the history of life. 'Chilesaurus shows how much data is still completely unknown about the early diversification of major dinosaur groups.’ He believes that this study will force palaeontologists to take more care in identifying fragmented and isolated dinosaur bones. Dr Fernando Novas, of the Bernardino Rivadavia Natural Sciences Museum in Buenos Aires, Argentina, led the research on Chilesaurus. Seven-year-old Diego Suárez (pictured left) came across the fossils when he and his sister, Macarena, were looking for decorative stones. He was at the site while his his geologist parents, Manuel Suarez (pictured right) and Rita de la Cruz were studying rocks with the aim to better understand the formation of the Andes . Experts initially thought Diego had unearthed several species, due to Chilesaurus' unusual combination of features. Here, a palaeontologist painstakingly excavates the fossils . He said: ‘Chilesaurus is the first complete dinosaur from the Jurassic Period found in Chile and represents one of the most complete and anatomically correct documented theropod dinosaurs from the southern hemisphere. ‘Although plant-eating theropods have been recorded in North America and Asia, this is the first time a theropod with this characteristic has been found in a southern landmass. ‘Chilesaurus was an odd plant-eating dinosaur only to be found in Chile. ‘However, the recurrent discovery in beds of the Toqui Formation of its bones and skeletons clearly demonstrates that Chilesaurus was, by far, the most abundant dinosaur in southwest Patagonia 145 million years ago.' The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over the course of 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping the unlikely transformation. The tree showed that the branch of theropod dinosaurs, which gave rise to modern birds, were the only dinosaurs that kept getting smaller. The lineage of huge meat-eating dinosaurs that transformed into agile flying birds were able to survive because they shrank over 50 million years. This is the conclusion scientists came to after constructing a detailed family tree of dinosaurs and their bird descendants, mapping their unlikely transformation . Theropods, meaning ‘beast-footed’, were a group of dinosaurs which include the carnivorous dinosaurs Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. 'These bird ancestors also evolved new adaptations, such as feathers, wishbones and wings, four times faster than other dinosaurs,' said co-author Darren Naish, a palaeontologist at the University of Southampton. Lead author Associate Professor Michael Lee, from the University of Adelaide, said: 'Birds evolved through a unique phase of sustained miniaturisation in dinosaurs.' 'Being smaller and lighter in the land of giants, with rapidly evolving anatomical adaptations, provided these bird ancestors with new ecological opportunities, such as the ability to climb trees, glide and fly. ‘Ultimately, this evolutionary flexibility helped birds survive the deadly meteorite impact which killed off all their dinosaurian cousins.' Researchers examined over 1,500 anatomical traits of dinosaurs to reconstruct their family tree. They used mathematical modelling to trace evolving adaptions and changing body size over time and across dinosaur branches.","Chilesaurus diegosuarezi was discovered by a child in southern Chile .

Now, the council want to move Mr Clark from the house he has lived in for the past 50 years into a care home because they claim it is cheaper. Scroll down for video . Help for Heroes has given Robbie Clark, pictured, an emergency grant so he can remain at home in London . The JustGiving paged more than half of the £5,000 target within a couple of hours of it going live this morning . However, Help for Heroes has launched its own JustGiving page to help Mr Clark. The charity has already given Mr Clark and emergency grant to fund his immediate care needs, but they are seeking the public's help to secure his future. They have so far raised £2,736.22 of the £5,000 needed. Any extra money will go towards the care of other former servicemen and women in need of assistance. Linda Walton, head of grants at Help for Heroes, said: 'Help for Heroes is all about supporting those who have been psychologically or physically wounded in service of our country. 'Robbie suffered severe anxiety and distress as a prisoner of war during the Second World War, and it is wrong that he should be subject to these feelings once again. 'We will do everything we can to ensure Robbie gets the support he deserves.' Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war  - and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march - has been given the emergency grant through the Help for Heroes quick reaction fund. Having spent his savings on home care, Mr Clark, from Brent, north west London, faced being forced out of his home into a residential care home, something he said would 'remind me of being a prisoner of war'. Mr Clark is blind, deaf in one ear and dependent on a wheelchair, suffered 'severe anxiety' when he was a prisoner of war. A total of 165,000 people have signed a petition calling for home help, the charity said. More than £2,500 has been donated on a JustGiving fundraising page. Mr Clark was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the ‘death march’ in 1945. Hitler ordered thousands of PoWs to march west for four months in extreme winter weather as the Russians advanced from the East. Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . After the war, the soldier married his sweetheart Rita and worked as a carpenter. In 1969 the couple moved into the house where he still lives in Burnt Oak, north London. Mrs Clark died in 2010 aged 91. Now a great-great-grandfather and one of Britain’s oldest surviving PoWs, Mr Clark is registered blind, deaf in one ear and is dependent on a wheelchair. For the past two years he has used his £50,000 savings to pay towards a £960-a-week live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed £350 a week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding and Mr Clark may have to go into a care home instead. His son, Mike, who said his home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, is not suitable for the pensioner, added: ‘This is causing my father to be very anxious and he is unable to sleep. ‘He’s as good as told me that if he has to move, he’ll just give up on life. Whenever he’s been in hospital, he … pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. ‘He hates being anywhere which isn’t familiar … going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.’ Despite tens of thousands signing the petition to allow Mr Clark to stay in his own home, Brent Council said they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer. The council’s Phil Porter said: ‘We recognise Mr Clark’s contribution to this country and sincerely empathise with the situation that he and other older people … are in. ‘However … the care package that Mr Clark is choosing is not affordable to council taxpayers given the constraints of local government funding and the need to be consistent for the 2,900 people we support.’ He added: ‘Mr Clark owns his home, so there is absolutely no question of Brent Council evicting him despite what has been suggested in this petition.’ The council said Mr Clark’s needs can be met in a care home for £451 a week. Alternatively, he could choose to receive the same weekly sum and stay at home, but would have to pay the extra amount necessary for a carer. Mr Porter said: ‘We want to find a solution which meets his eligible social care needs, provides value for money for the taxpayer, but also reflects the choices he has made and the additional cost this creates.’ He added that the council had offered ‘a deferred payment which means he doesn’t need to sell his house to pay for his care’. After signatures hit the 127,000 mark this morning, a spokeswoman said: 'Our position hasn't changed since the petition was at 75,000.' Mr Clark’s family reported the case to the Local Government Ombudsman, but the watchdog agreed with the council.","Great-grandfather Robert Clark has lived in the house for 50 years .

There is a soft swell of conversation as afternoon tea is served, a clink of cutlery on crockery, the discreet burble of tea being poured into china cups. Somewhere outside, the clouds part and light floods the lounge. I reach for another scone, ladle on a hearty dose of jam and cream, and marvel that, in this context, 70 years seems an eternity. Rewind those seven decades and Guernsey's only five-star hotel – pitched on the hillside above the harbour in the capital St Peter Port – would have been home to a decidedly less relaxed atmosphere. Seventy years on: St Peter Port in Guernsey is one of the key locations for the Heritage Festival . During the German occupation of the Channel Islands (30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945), this stately retreat was commandeered as the General Staff Headquarters. Invading officers would have stalked its corridors. By April 1945, they would have been wearing sour expressions as the tide of conflict turned back on Berlin, and the Channel Islands – bypassed by the D-Day fightback of ten months earlier - awaited their salvation. That eventual liberation is being celebrated again this month – and with gusto. The ongoing Channel Islands Heritage Festival (3 April–11 May) is a five-week hurrah of history, parades, concerts and food that will unite most of the archipelago – Guernsey, Alderney, Jersey, Herm and Sark. This is no small feat. Fiercely individual, the islands have never before combined to stage a big event. But here they have common cause. Liberation Day itself will turn St Peter Port and Jersey's capital St Helier into swirls of people and music. It is not difficult to find traces of Guernsey's harrowing half-decade. The occupation lingers in the old German fortifications that litter the coastline – the swarthy, sinister tower of Fort Saumarez which rears up on the west coast; the similarly menacing Fort Hommet in the north. Intrigued, I stroll into the stiff winds which burst up from the sea to walk around the hard muscle of Pleinmont Tower, on the south-west shore. It is an oddly unnerving experience, the pillar-box slots in the bastion's sides eyeing me quietly. When I face the water, I almost expect to feel the chill metal of a machine-gun barrel on my neck. Coastal curves: Guernsey's dramatic shoreline includes the wide expanse of Portelet Bay . You can go further into Guernsey's wartime heritage. What appears to be a car park behind La Colinette Hotel on the western outskirts of St Peter Port reveals itself as the hub of enemy communications in the Channel Islands. Hidden down a damp flight of stairs, the former German Naval Signals Headquarters is all but invisible unless you know it is there. This, of course, was the point. Its unremarkable door gives onto a vast underground space which once hummed with radio chatter, semaphore murmur and serious conversation. German signs and instructions are still daubed onto the walls. The bunker will be open to the public as part of the festival – its secrets brought into the light. The German Occupation Museum at Les Houards offers further perspective, flitting from frivolity to fear – on one hand the photo album of Freda Oliver, a local girl who dated (and married) a German officer; on the other, exhibits on the inevitable fate of the island's Jewish population, and copies of the Guernsey Evening Press turned to propaganda sheet. The darkness of life under Nazi rule is most obvious at the German Military Underground Hospital, at La Vassalerie. This enormous labyrinth was carved out by the slave-labour sweat of prisoners of war – plenty of whom died in the process. As did many of the injured German troops brought here from France after the D-Day landings. With its dank passages and horror-film ambience, the hospital is the definition of an unhappy building. An island guardian: Mont Orgueil Castle has protected the east coast of Jersey since the 13th century . The picture is replicated 27 miles to the south-east. Jersey is a short hop from Guernsey – around an hour by fast ferry, less by air. Here, the Jersey War Tunnels – another military-medical complex – have been restored into something less frightening, with museum displays and fascinating facts slotted into the long tunnels. The side-effects of occupation can be seen here – the breakdown of society apparent in transcripts of letters where neighbours informed on each other about hidden radios and petty jealousies. But so can the joy that liberation brought. Glorious video footage shows euphoria in St Helier as the news of German surrender broke; the Union Jack being hoisted at the Pomme D'Or Hotel. The hotel came to symbolise the Channel Islands' moment of deliverance. In a way, it still does, peering across what is now called Liberation Square, where a tall bronze sculpture captures seven people in the act of raising the flag – laughing, as if they are flying a kite. Other echoes resound across St Helier. The Jersey Museum and Art Gallery has a catalogue of copies of the Jersey Evening Post dating back 125 years, its photos recalling the war era in day-by-day detail (albeit through a fog of strict German control). The nearby Maritime Museum proffers the Occupation Tapestry Gallery – a montage of bright images, stitched by islanders for the 50th anniversary of liberation in 1995, which depict Jersey brought to heel – armed troops in the streets, the island hemmed in by a ragged circle of fire. And the Jersey Archive is host to a remarkable resource – over 30,000 of the Occupation Registration Cards which were forced on islanders by the Nazi authorities. There are no smiles here – just a series of furrowed brows and unhappy faces. Bright days ahead: A view of the pretty coastal enclave of Gorey from the ramparts of Mont Orgueil Castle . The heaviness of the German bootprint is perhaps summed up by Battery Lothringen – a concrete watchdog which looks like it might still bite. This colossal bunker – which will also be accessible during the festival – 'protected' St Helier from the far side of St Aubin's Bay. The stairs into its depths seem to go down forever, to gun posts, control rooms and sleeping quarters – the decades peeling away as I walk in the firm footsteps of the enemy. And yet, just seven miles north-west, it all feels like a bad dream. St Brelade's Bay Hotel gazes at the water in a rather more benign manner. In the summer of 1940, it was another German outpost, requisitioned as a hang-out by Luftwaffe pilots. It is not difficult to grasp why it was coveted. Over breakfast, I peer out of the wide restaurant windows – at waves rolling gently up to the beach, and at St Brelade's, a pretty block of an 11th century church whose graveyard hovers above the sand. There is no stomp of marching boots this morning – but for five weeks, the Channel Islands are remembering a time when there was.

However they were amazed to find the man had actually swallowed hundreds of coins and nails. Over a three year period Rajpal Singh, 34, had swallowed 140 coins, 150 nails and a handful of nuts, bolts and batteries. He had also gulped down screws, nails and magnets. Rajpal Singh, 34, had hundreds of coins and other objects removed from his stomach after complaining of an ache. The image shows an X-ray with the mass of metal objects shown in white in his stomach . Doctors were amazed when an endoscopy (a long thin tube with a camera attached) revealed hundreds of foreign objects inside Mr Singh's stomach. The endoscopy is pictured . Over a three year period, Mr Singh had swallowed, 140 coins, 150 nails and nuts and bolts, batteries and magnets. Some of the objects removed are pictured . When doctors carried out an endoscopy – inserting a long, thin, tube with a camera attached to the end – it revealed the hundreds of foreign objects in his stomach. Mr Singh, a farmer from Bathinda in India's western state of Punjab, said his bizarre habit began after he fell into a depression, and eating metal objects brought him comfort. He said: 'I used to gulp down coins and metals with fruit juice or milk. 'Due to family problems I had slipped into depression and got hooked onto this weird habit. 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died. 'I feel much more relaxed now. I am never going to do this again.' Mr Singh claims he didn't realise his stomach pain was due to his habit of eating metal objects. Doctors have carried out 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects, as well as a nine-hour operation. But Mr Singh will still need another procedure to remove the rest of the metal . Pictured are X-rays of Mr Singh's stomach, revealing the mass of foreign objects. Mr Singh said: 'Doctors have told me those sharp objects would have punctured my intestine and I would have eventually died' Dr Gagendeep Goyal (pictured centre in blue) led a team of five doctors who carried out the operation to remove the objects from Mr Singh's abdomen . He went to many medical centres in Punjab complaining of a painful ache in his abdomen, but no doctors could diagnose the problem. Finally, Dr Gagandeep Goyal, a gastroentologist at a local hospital, carried out an X-ray and revealed the mass of metal deep in Mr Singh's stomach. He has since carried out more than 240 endoscopy procedures to remove the objects - yet some still remain. Leading a team of  five doctors, he also carried out a nine hour operation to remove more of the metal, yet Mr Singh will still need another operation to remove the rest. Dr Goyal said: 'The patient came to us with severe stomach pain. When we did the endoscopy we were shocked to see so many foreign bodies, including coins and sharp objects in his stomach. 'Though we have managed to remove most of them, there are still sharp injects and coins in his stomach. 'His body is too fragile to sustain another operation now so we plan to operate again in about seven days and remove the remaining objects.' Mr Singh says he feels calmer now and will not swallow metal objects again. Pictured are some coins removed from his stomach .","Rajpal Singh, 34, had become depressed and began eating metal objects .

2059c7857d0d456a01bca2936dce366b65dc9132,"A Canadian prostitute says that she wishes  other people wouldn't make her feel so ashamed of working in the sex industry - because she actually really enjoys her job. Celine Bisette, who uses this pseudonym whenever she is discussing her career, insists she is neither 'damaged' nor 'deranged' - that, in fact, she rather enjoys being a prostitute, and it's only the social stigma surrounding her career choice that leaves her feeling unhappy. 'I am embarrassed to be a sex worker, even though I like my job, I’m good at it, and I’ve made exceptional progress in my career over the past few years,' she wrote in a recent essay for xoJane. This pro has pride: Canadian prostitute Celine Bisette, pictured here, wishes other people wouldn't make her feel embarrassed about her job . First, Celine would like everyone to abandon whatever assumptions they've made about prostitutes. She claims that she didn't have an abusive childhood, she's not a 'hyper-sexual nympho', and she isn't uneducated. She had 'an incredibly fortunate upbringing', she said, adding that she got along well with her parents and older sister: '[It was] just about the best any child could possibly hope for.' Then, as a 19-year-old college sophomore, she found herself in need of a way to pay for school. A minimum-wage job wouldn't earn her enough money, and she didn't want to take out student loans. Her best option, she said, was the sex industry. 'I couldn’t bring myself to do porn, and I knew wasn’t talented enough to be a stripper,' she explained. Working as an escort seemed like a natural choice for Celine, as it was easy and it paid well - seeing just one or two clients a week covered her bills. It just didn't occur to her that others might not be so at ease with her decision. In the beginning, she'd readily tell people at parties what she did for part-time work. She was still out-going then, she said, and never felt self-conscious. But peoples' reactions quickly changed the way she approached conversations about her job. They would lecture her, insult her, and accuse her of being a 'traitor to feminism'. One friend told everyone in their social circle that Celine must be mentally unstable to have chosen such a career, and might have even been molested as a child. The rumor took off, and Celine lost a lot of friends in the process. Now, after about a decade in the industry, she is much more reticent about revealing what she does, for fear of eliciting those same negative reactions. But while she has a 'mainstream' part-time job that she uses as a 'cover', she finds it frustrating that she can't be more open. 'I wish I could feel proud of who I am and what I do,' she said. 'I’m tired of feeling embarrassed and ashamed.' Sexy and smart: Celine, who wants to keep her real identity a secret, says she's more than just an escort - she also has her master's degree in sociology . Even when she does tell people about her work as an escort, Celine makes a point to emphasize that she also has a master’s degree in sociology: 'I hype it up and draw attention to it, as if to say, “Yes, I’m a [prostitute], but I’m also smart and normal, really, I promise!”' Because of the social stigma, she sometimes thinks about quitting altogether - but she hesitates because the work is easy, her schedule is flexible, and she makes twice as much as she would doing a job in her field of study. Plus, she explained, she can't erase her history in the sex industry. 'I will always be seen as damaged goods, whether I am a current sex worker or a former one. So I might as well just keep going, right?' In fact, despite liking her job, it's not Canada's ambiguous laws on prostitution that give Celine pause - being paid for sex is legal, but living off that payment of it is not. Rather, it's the negative reactions to her job that make her regret ever taking up sex work at all. 'I wish I’d known what I was getting myself into before I jumped into this line of work,' she said. 'But most of all, I wish I’d never become a prostitute in the first place.'","Celine Bisette, from Canada, became an escort when she was in college .

3f034e41bd128350195c9dd75a74258f86b1fd06,"Los Angeles (CNN)Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight was ordered Thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton"" earlier this year. In addition to that ruling, Judge Ronald Coen also lowered Knight's bail to $10 million from $25 million, a figure that defense lawyers called excessive. The judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against Knight. In all, Knight will stand trial on one count of murder, one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run, the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended Thursday. Knight, 49, faces up to life in prison if convicted. Knight suffers diabetes and blot clots, and the case has clearly strained him: He collapsed in court last month after learning of the $25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Knight was in court Thursday. At the end of hearing, he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery, and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom. In a press conference after the hearing, fiancee Toi Kelly said regarding Knight's health that he is ""doing much better."" The judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because California law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon, in this case the vehicle Knight was driving, is used against several people. Knight is accused of running over two men, killing one of them, during an argument. Killed was Terry Carter, 55. The survivor is Cle Sloan, 51, who in testimony this week declined to identify Knight as his attacker because Sloan doesn't want to be a ""snitch"" who sends Knight to prison, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Prosecutors offered Sloan immunity, but he still refused to testify against Knight on Monday, the affiliates reported. The deadly incident happened on January 29, after a flare-up on the set of the biopic ""Straight Outta Compton,"" a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group N.W.A. The alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of Tam's Burgers in Compton. At the time, Knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case. The hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows Knight inside a red truck. In the video, the truck pulls into the entrance of the Compton restaurant, and he is then approached by Sloan, who was working security on the site. The two men appear to talk for a few moments, with Knight still in his vehicle. Suddenly, the vehicle backs up, knocking Sloan to the ground. While still in reverse, the truck moves out of range of the security camera. The vehicle is then seen zooming forward, back into camera range, running over Sloan a second time, and then running over a second man, Carter, a former rap music label owner. Carter later died. In closing arguments prior to the judge's ruling, Knight's attorney Matthew Fletcher argued that Knight was the victim. Knight was only defending himself against Sloan, whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time. ""Mr. Sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor,"" Knight's attorney argued. ""There's no intent to kill, there's an intent to survive."" ""Even without a gun, we know Mr. Sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight,"" the defense attorney said. Fletcher added that Knight's defense was to stand his ground. Sloan ""needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor,"" Fletcher said. ""He is the person who got Terry (Carter) killed."" Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Cynthia Barnes argued, however, told the judge that Knight was engaged in ""mutual combat situation"" where he used his car as deadly weapon. If Knight ""ever had the right of self-defense, the moment he backed-up and Mr. Sloan was ran-over, he lost the right of self-defense,"" Barnes said. ""There was pre-mediation and intent when he (Knight) ran over him a second time."" Knight is scheduled to be arraigned on April 30. The incident is the latest run-in with the law for Knight, who founded the wildly successful Death Row Records in 1991 and signed artists such as Snoop Doggy Dogg (now known as Snoop Lion) and Tupac Shakur. Knight was driving the car in which Shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in Las Vegas in 1996. Shortly afterward, Knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions. That prison time -- along with Shakur's death, feuds between Knight and a number of rappers, and desertions by Dr. Dre, Snoop and others -- contributed to the label's bankruptcy in 2006. In August, Knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled Sunset Strip party hosted by singer Chris Brown on the eve of the MTV Video Music Awards.","Former rap mogul Marion ""Suge"" Knight will be tried for murder in a videotaped hit-and-run .

Dashcam footage, shared by dailymotion.com user Vidsking, shows a giant St. Bernard  running across a road somewhere in the Czech Republic with a child trailing behind.

The incident took place in Olani village, four kilometres from Manpur, in central India and was recorded by terrified villagers from the relative safety of hut rooftops. To try and protect his fellow villagers, the fearless ward ran towards the leopard brandishing the weapon. The brave village watchman stands on guard with his stick as the leopard moves towards him . Watched on by a crowd of bystanders, the ward beats the leopard twice on the head as it tries to slash him with its claws . Even though the man sits defenceless on the dusty earth, he continues to fend off the leopard with his stick . After a few terrifying seconds, the leopard - inches away from the man's bare feet - eventually runs off . He managed to strike the big cat on the head twice before it retaliated, dumping the ward to the ground. Astonished bystanders could be heard screaming as the leopard stood at the feet of the seemingly doomed man. Despite being injured on the floor and unable to move, the courageous ward continued to fend off the leopard with his stick and after a few seconds the animal ran off. Mahendra Sharma, a school teacher, said: 'Even the armed forest officials seldom muster courage to fight a beast.' According to local media, the man did not suffer any serious injuries as a result of his death-defying encounter. In last year's Indian elections, rural communities blamed the government for placing them at risk of leopard attacks by failing to provide basic infrastructure such as electrical lighting and street lighting.

It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure. A separate study, also commissioned by the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health, found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoors thinking they were not at risk from the sun and sunburn or were unsure if they were. The study found there was a 'macho culture' in some parts of the construction industry, with two thirds of workers who spent an average of nearly seven hours a day outdoorst hinking they were not at risk . The institution urged businesses to improve 'sun safety', for example by minimising workers' exposure in the middle of the day. More than half (59%) of those questioned reported having had sunburn - a major contributor to skin cancer - at least once in the last year. Researchers also found a 'macho culture' in some parts of the industry and misconceptions about the threat of ultraviolet radiation in climates like the UK's as cloud cover does not give total protection from the sun. The studies' findings are being published as part of an Institution of Occupational Safety and Health No Time To Lose campaign to beat work-related cancers, with businesses urged to develop 'sun safety strategies'. It found nearly 250 cases of malignant melanoma are registered each year by those working outside in industries such as construction, agriculture and leisure . The strategies should include regular updates on the UV index from weather forecasts, minimising sun exposure in the middle of the day and asking employees to wear long-sleeved, loose-fitting tops and trousers. While using high-factor sunscreen is helpful it should not be relied on as the only barrier to the harmful rays, employers are advised. IOSH executive director of policy Shelley Frost said: 'We've a clear picture for the UK now of the number of people diagnosed with or dying from skin cancer because of sun exposure at work. 'It's a terrible disease but with some simple measures we can ensure people who work outside are not exposed to the solar radiation that causes it. 'Work-related skin cancer is avoidable but businesses and their employees hold the key to beating it and today we are showing them how it can be done.'","50 die each year as a result of being exposed to the sun at work in Britain .

1695970eb33fa22c46048addc4185fd7dcc73283,"Washington (CNN)The U.S. said Tuesday that deploying warships to Yemen to monitor nearby Iranian vessels has given America ""options"" for how it could react to Iran's behavior in the region. The warships are being deployed to monitor ships traveling from Iran that could be trafficking arms to Houthi rebels in Yemen, U.S. officials told CNN, saying the move was also meant to reassure allies in the region. ""By having American sea power in the region, we have created options for ourselves,"" said Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren. He noted that the nine ships in the Iranian convoy were cargo ships, but he declined to specify what they were carrying beyond ""containers."" International officials are concerned that Iran could surreptitiously attempt to transfer weaponry to the Houthis. President Barack Obama told MSNBC that the United States has been clear in its messages to Tehran on sending weapons to Houthi rebels inside Yemen. ""What we've said to them is if there are weapons delivered to factions within Yemen that could threaten navigation, that's a problem,"" Obama said in the interview, a clip of which aired on NBC Nightly News. ""We're not sending them obscure messages, we send them very direct messages about it,"" Obama said. While the Iranian ships remain in international waters, the U.S. and other partner nations can keep an eye on the Iranian ships to see if they move toward Yemeni territorial waters. But it would be an extraordinary step and certainly not a foregone conclusion that the U.S. would attempt to board an Iranian ship if it entered Yemeni waters, U.S. officials said. ""I want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression. They are not there to intercept Iranian ships,"" State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters Tuesday. ""The purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe."" Warren too added that he was unaware of any direct contact between the American and Iranian vessels at this point. The Obama administration and U.S. defense officials maintain the primary purpose of positioning additional U.S. warships in the region is to ensure the free flow of commerce through established international shipping lanes and to ensure maritime security in the region. There is a message for Iran as well. A U.S. military official told CNN that aircraft from aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt are also conducting ""manned reconnaissance"" to monitor all maritime traffic moving through the area the Roosevelt is operating in to determine what is going on there in order to assist in making informed decisions. This official stressed that the repositioning of U.S. ships in the region was taken in order to assure the freedom of navigation through established international shipping lanes and ensuring maritime security and not to interdict Iranian ships. The Roosevelt aircraft carrier and the guided missile cruiser USS Normandy were the two ships the Navy moved into the waters off the coast of Yemen on Sunday. At this stage, there are nine U.S. naval ships operating off the coast in Yemen. ""The United States alongside the international community, including the United Nations, is serious about the Iranians not providing weapons to the Houthis,"" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. ""Providing weapons to the Houthis only exacerbates the violence and instability in this region in a way that will have continued terrible impact on the humanitarian situation in the country."" The heightened tensions could have broader consequences for the relationship between the U.S. and Iran, coming weeks after the announcement of a framework agreement to limit Iran's nuclear program. Officials on Capitol Hill and elsewhere pointed out that the situation in Yemen adds an additional challenge when it comes to reaching a final deal. ""I don't think this changes something directly, but it does highlight that Iran has a number of activities around the region and around the world that are problematic,"" Texas Rep. Mac Thornberry, the Republican chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN Tuesday. ""It includes their missile program, it includes their growing influence in Iraq, it includes their propping up of (President Bashar al-) Assad in Syria and their fueling this war in Yemen."" U.S. warships from the carrier group of the Roosevelt are joining allied vessels from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and other partner nations prepared to intercept a convoy of seven to nine Iranian vessels believed headed for Yemen. ""We are closely monitoring all maritime activity in the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Aden,"" Cmdr. Kevin Stephens of the Fifth Fleet told CNN. ""We not going discuss the number and types of vessels we are monitoring or speculate about the possible destination or cargo of those vessels."" When asked about warnings from Saudi Arabia and the U.S. to keep Iranian navy ships away from Yemen, the commander of Iran's Regular Navy, Flotilla Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, said his fleet was operating legally. ""We don't let anyone give us warnings and threats, because we are working according to international law and regulations,"" he said. ""And we work for the security of our country and other countries."" Sayyari added that Iranian navy ships in the area were there to combat piracy and secure the safe transfer of goods through the waters. U.S. ships do not have authority to forcibly board Iranian-flagged ships. Earlier this month, a U.S. Navy ship consensually boarded a Panamanian-flagged vessel suspected of trafficking people, drugs or weapons. Nothing was found. The U.S. warships come to a region seeing a good deal of U.S. military activity. The Roosevelt in particular only recently arrived in the theater and had been in the Arabian Gulf supporting Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria, according to Stephens. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on the ""Situation Room"" that he would only endorse U.S. air power against Yemen if it was the only option. ""It is a very serious escalatory step,"" he said on Monday. ""If you're going to use U.S. air power, what else is going to happen to make sure you stop the Houthis?"" McCain blamed President Barack Obama's foreign policy for the deteriorating situation. ""It was very obvious to many of us that this did not have to happen,"" McCain said. ""We did not take care of the regime that was in place, the president that was in there. It is a symptom of our failure throughout the Middle East."" CNN's Jim Acosta, Frederik Pleitgen, Theodore Schleifer and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","U.S. Navy moves aircraft carrier, cruiser to waters near Yemen .

So it comes as a surprise that the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) - located along the no-man's land between the North and South - is next to a burgeoning surf spot for South Korean hipsters, gangsters, ex-pats and its jet-setting adventure class. Photos captured at the site show an eclectic mix of people going about their day-to-day duties, where fishermen and day-trippers are placed alongside soldiers, tanks and their fortified military installations. The DMZ was established in 1953 as a buffer zone to separate the North from the South. Surfer Shannon Aston, from New Zealand, said he felt compelled to start photographing the area while he was living and working in South Korea as a teacher. Mr Aston added: 'The military is ever present and must be respected and everybody does (respect it), but Korea has been divided for decades, so life just goes on. 'There was never much tension, only when people in the north would defect near that coast or security was ramped up after a skirmish or incident between the two countries.' The beaches, often filled with foreigners and day-trippers from the capital Seoul, features an 'overlapping' of military installations along the coast as it nears the border with the north, he said.

Out of 17 bingo halls tested seven showed traces of cocaine, while another had traces of crack cocaine, a more dangerous form of the drug that is smoked, a newspaper investigation revealed. While the venues do let players as young as 18 in, the majority of attendees are elderly, and the discoveries mirror a spike in OAPs being treated for drug abuse. Out of 17 bingo halls tested across the country, seven had traces of cocaine in the toilets, while this one, in Hengrove Leisure Park, Bristol, was found to have traces of crack cocaine . Class A: While bingo halls allow people as young as 18 to visit, the majority of visitors are pensioners (pictured, Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol, where traces of cocaine were found in the toilets) Figures from Public Health England show that 634 pensioners over 65 were treated for substance abuse in the last year, a rise of 20 per cent in a year, and double the rates seen in 2009. A probe by The Sun used swabs coated with special chemicals which reveal traces of cocaine to test toilet cubicles in bingo halls around the country. The news comes as hospital figures reveal a spike in drug abuse among the elderly, with 634 treated for addiction last year (stock picture) Two Gala Bingo premises in Clydebank Retail Park and Hawthorne Quadrant, Glasgow, tested positive for the drug, while Mecca Bingo in Coral Island, Blackpool, also showed traces of cocaine. Gala Bingo in Basildon and Mecca Bingo in Romford, Essex, also had positive results, as did Gala Bingo in Fishponds Road, Bristol. Another Bristol venue, Gala Bingo in Hengrove Leisure Park, tested positive for crack cocaine, which is highly addictive. Kate Lawrence, of drug charity Phoenix Futures, told the paper’s Grant Rollings that the findings were unsurprising, adding that many older people turn to drugs to combat loneliness, or to socialise. She said: 'We assume older people don't want to go out and socialise, but they do, particularly if they are lonely. Loneliness is a massive trigger for drugs. 'The older generation isn't so well informed because we have concentrated on warning young people about drugs. Representatives from both Mecca Bingo and Gala Bingo said that their companies took a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and banned taking them on their premises. Figures released early last year showed that, as well as record numbers of pensioners being hospitalised with drug problems, thousands more were seeking help to kick the habit. Busted: Mecca Bingo Blackpool was among the eight premises where traces of Class A drugs were found . Zero tolerance: Both Gala Bingo and Mecca Bingo said drug taking was banned in both of their venues (pictured, Gala Bingo in Basildon, where cocaine traces were discovered) More than 2,000 people in their 60s, 70s and 80s sought help for problems relating to substance abuse in 2013 - double the number that were receiving treatment only five years ago. The dramatic rise is being blamed on those who first experimented with drugs during the 1960s, and have continued to use them on and off over the subsequent decades. The majority of those requesting help last year suffered from addictions to heroin or crack cocaine, although there were significant numbers who had problems with cannabis, amphetamines and prescription medications.","Out of 17 bingo halls tested, seven revealed traces of cocaine in toilets .

The four men appeared in turn in a courtroom in Dartmouth, near Halifax, where they were given identical but unusual bail conditions that could see them having to live on a Canadian naval base for the next few years. Bail was set at over £2,000 for each of them but they also agreed to surrender their passports and live at the nearby Stadacona naval base in Halifax. Accused: Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer from Stockbridge, Hampshire, arrives at court today . Two of the accused, Simon Radford, 31, of Gosport, Hampshire and Craig Stoner, 24, from Stonehouse, Gloucestershire hid their faces as they were led to a provincial court in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia . Darren Smalley, 35, of Gosport, Hampshire, and his co-accused were ordered to surrender their passports as part of their bail conditions . In a deal agreed with the British government, they will also continue to work for the Royal Navy and draw their current pay. It was not clear last night how they will keep themselves occupied thousands of miles from their shipmates and a representative from the British High Commission who was in court refused to elaborate. The four – Joshua Finbow, 23, a submarine engineer, Craig Stoner, 24, Simon Radford, 31, and Darren Smalley, 35 – had been playing for the Royal Navy ice hockey team in a tournament at the Shearwater naval base just east of Halifax. The alleged sexual assault, in which police sources say all four men had sexual intercourse with their victim, took place on April 10 after the sailors had returned to the barracks from a hockey game. Sources say their victim, who is aged in her early 20s and lives in Halifax, had accompanied a friend who had been invited to attend the party by local Canadian servicemen. Yesterday, all four men – three of them wearing black Royal Navy ice hockey team hoodies – looked relieved to be getting out of custody as they respectfully answered Judge John MacDougall’s questions. Charged: Royal Navy sailors Joshua Finbow, 23, (left) and Simon Radford, 31, (right) appeared in court . Held: Craig Stoner, 24, (left) and Darren Smalley, 35, (right) are being held by military police in Canada . They all said they understood their bail conditions and Crown prosecutor Eric Taylor said outside court that the accused had not asked to be returned to the UK. They were ordered to return to court on May 27 and given the names of seven people – the victim and six witnesses – who they were forbidden to contact. They must not leave the province of Nova Scotia and cannot apply for new passports. They must remain employed by the navy and must not resign without the court’s permission. The four, no longer trying to hide their faces, later filed out of the court building and were driven away together in a large white SUV to their new home on the close Stadacona base. They ignored a question over how they might plead in the case. Commander Michael O’Sullivan, the air and naval advisor at the British High Commission, has spoken to the four and described the alleged offences as ‘serious’ but stressed they were as yet only allegations. Naval base: The East Coast Navy base at Halifax, Nova Scotia, near to where the alleged incident occurred . Military base: An aerial view of the Shearwater military base where four British sailors are accused of assaulting a civilian . The Commander, who drove the car the men left the court in, added: ‘We’re assisting the Canadian authorities with their investigation.’ The four are charged with sexual assault causing bodily harm and group sexual assault – offences that are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Crown prosecutor Eric Taylor said the investigation was still at an early stage and the results of forensic tests could result in additional charges. ‘It will be up to the Royal Navy to decide now how to employ them while their charges are working their way through the court,’ he said. Canadian military investigators have described the alleged offences as ‘a disturbing accusation of sexual assault’.

d467b8bd70dc904ceaa43cd5804b29cf9cb205c6,"When Nic Newling recalls his childhood, he remembers misleading highs and deep depressions where the only option he could see for himself was committing suicide. But it was the unexpected and tragic death of his teenage brother, Christopher, who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective. Now, the 28-year-old is using his story of loss and confusion - in which he moved between doctors and psychiatric wards and was fed various concoctions of prescriptive medication before finally being diagnosed with bipolar disorder - to raise awareness of mental illness. Mental health advocate Nic Newling struggled through the confusing highs and depressing lows of an undiagnosed bipolar disorder between the ages of 13 and 18 . It was the unexpected and tragic death of his older, teenage brother Christopher (pictured right with Nic left), who killed himself amidst his own quieter battle with mental illnesses, which helped put his life back into perspective . Academically driven from a young age, Nic said that the time he was eight years old, he had planned his whole life out in his mind with the intention of becoming a vet. 'I got into a high school with a scholarship; at that point I was really happy for the first six months, but I pushed myself too hard and put an unrealistic amount of pressure on myself and just crashed. What it looked like was not having any other interests, being snappy and grumpy and angry - which are all things that are not like me at all,' he told Daily Mail Australia. His bad moods progressed into forms of anxiety and depression and what Nic described as an 'overwhelming sadness that didn't come from any particular place', before taking on a level of psychosis. 'When things first started getting bad, I was experiencing symptoms of agitation, panic attacks, I was withdrawing from friends and life and not finding pleasure in the things that I used to find pleasurable, I was experiencing what I thought was OCD behaviors and I started thinking I was hearing things that weren't real,' he said. Both Nic (left) and Christopher (centre, with eldest brother Ben right) suffered from mental health problems at the same time . Unlike Nic (left), Christopher (with Ben right) was not as open about his emotions and his anxiety and depression. His death came as a shock to the family who had been focusing on Nic's struggles . 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. 'I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room.' By year eight, Nic had admitted himself into a psychiatric ward - a move that marked the beginning of years of confusions and various treatments including electroconvulsive therapy - in a desperate bid to rid himself of his confusing emotions. 'On average, statistics show that it takes 20 years for someone with bipolar to go from having the symptoms to being diagnosed - and that's not even treating it,' Nic said. 'Compared to that, I'm one of the lucky ones.' A high achiever from a young age, Nic (pictured left and right) 'crashed' after pushing himself too hard in the first year of high school . His anxiety and depression progressed into a type of psychosis and he soon admitted himself into a psychiatric ward for almost nine months . But along with the cold, stale, square rooms, the psychiatric wards offered a surprising comfort: other people who were not afraid to talk about mental illness. 'I really liked that psych ward. I didn't want to leave because I met so many people there from different backgrounds and religions and with different ideas about the world … and the reason I really got along with these guys was because it was the first time I had met other people with mental health issues and that it was such a non-issue. 'They'd be like ""what have you got?"" and I'd say ""I think I have psychosis or depression"" and they'd just say ""OK, cool. Do you want to play Nintendo now?"" That planted the seed a little bit: maybe talking about this stuff is really helpful, not damaging.' The level of support and acceptance of mental health problems that Nic experienced was a far cry from the experience of his older brother Christopher. 'Everyone was really worried about me being suicidal because it was such a measured thought-out decision for me - I was sort of at the point where I was convinced there was no point in living but couldn't deal with the guilty because my family had been so good to me,' Nic said. 'It was so hard to work at school because of the nature of the condition: it can have cognitive impairments, so I'd go from reading nonstop to not being able to listen to a word the teacher was saying. I'd literally just sit there in class and just fantasize about different ways I could kill myself with different objects in the room' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic (pictured) was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun . 'Then Chris ended up killing himself when I had just turned 16 and he was just shy of 18. 'He had his heart set on being a professional rugby player but had some problems with his legs and had to get surgery. He was bed ridden for a while and that made his depression and anxiety a lot worse because he pretty much just lived for rugby. 'He became withdrawn: he wouldn't talk about his depression. I was open about it to close friends and family whereas he would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man. Devastated by the unexpected turn of events, Nic's eldest brother was left to organize Christopher's funeral while his mother became a recluse and the rest of the family tried to shield Nic from the event, desperate to avoid another tragedy. Christopher's (left and right) mental health problems peaked after a surgery that left him bed ridden and unable to play rugby: 'He would really keep it close to his chest because he had a lot more to lose socially - he was an alpha-male, jock, lovable larrikin and athletic type and I think he really felt that if he would have talked about having depression and anxiety it would made him look like less of a man' 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness. 'After he died there were five chairs at the dinner table and only four people and you can't ignore that. We started having dinner in front of the television permanently because, what do you talk about? How can you discuss anything and have that chair sitting there?' It took at least another two years after his brother's death before Nic was correctly diagnosed with bi-polar and set on the correct path of treatment, but not without another stint in a psych ward and doctor's experimenting with every drug for depression under the sun. His death shattered their family: 'We stopped having Christmas that year because mum and dad couldn't deal with that emptiness,' Nic said (pictured from a young age with his brothers and father) 'Our first family Christmas in a very long time, just last year': Left to right Ben and his son Zach, mum, dad, Nic's best friend Ryle, Nic, and family friend Daisy . 'I'd had heaps of different meds for heaps of different diagnosis. I'd had shock therapy when I was 16 which was once I'd had every meds that existed for the condition and meant we were really scraping the bottom of the barrel by falling back on like 1960s meds,' he said. 'But it wasn't that the meds weren't working or the dosage was wrong, it was that I was being treatment for something I didn't have.' 'Now things are good. I take a small maintenance dose of medication, one pill a day, with no side effect: a mood stabilizer which just feels like taking a vitamin. I've got a great job working in mental health, I live with my best friend, have a great girlfriend - I don't want to say it's perfect, but what a dramatic turnaround!'

The UCO Stormproof Matches are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to them and will start burning again once they come into contact with oxygen. The unique matches have to go through rigorous testing to make sure they keep alight in even the most difficult situations. Scroll down for video . Indestructable: The UCO Stormproof Matches (pictured) are made using an incredibly tough coating that smoulders no matter what happens to it and will start burning again once it comes into contact with oxygen . Eric Moe, the product specialist at Industrial Revolution which owns Utility, Comfort and Originality (UCO), explained the process. The Stormproof matches are made by UCO which has been making outdoor accessories for the past 44 years. They include 25 matches in a completely waterproof case with and three strike pads. The matches cost £5.47 ($7.99) from UCO's website and are available from the UK distributor Dalesman International. He said: 'The match sticks are dipped into our coating, which keeps smouldering even underwater, then reignites once exposed to oxygen. 'Essentially, you aren't burning the match stick, but burning the coating on the stick. 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose. 'In all cases the flame keeps burning. The matches will still ignite if they get wet, and they are quite impact resistant.' Even when buried in sand (left), the matches can burn again once they are taken out and exposed to oxygen (right). They can also keep smouldering even while underwater . Mr Moe, 31, from Milton, near Seattle, Washington, US, said when you are in unfamiliar terrain, having a source of fire is vital for survival. He said: 'Whether they're in a snowstorm, rainstorm or wind storm, the UCO Stormproof Matches will offer heat and light. 'The importance of being able to create a fire in inclement weather cannot be overstated. 'These matches are designed to ignite and keep burning in the worst conditions. 'Everything is more challenging when you are cold and wet, and it is crucial to have reliable equipment.' The makers explained that essentially, the match stick isn't burning, it is the coating on the stick that is alight: 'We have drenched them in buckets, buried them in mud, and blown them with a compressed air hose' Here the match is shown being dipped into water (left), and when it is take out (right) it is still able to burn . He explained that other devices that are used to light a fire are not always reliable. Mr Moe said: 'Lighters can fail at high altitudes, or if wet. Standard matches have little resistance to elements. Primitive techniques are excellent, but hard to execute in poor weather.

566bd1ce515078f08ad1bd91c2baec06c3ea4947,"The Long Island mother and daughter found safe and well in New York City's Upper West Side neighbourhood after going missing last month say they had no idea that people were looking for them. Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily, 14, were recognized by the front desk manager of the hotel they were staying at on Sunday, it was reported. They were found at 3am by NYPD officers and are in good health, officials said. Scroll down for video . Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily were visiting Manhattan when they disappeared. They have now been found safe and well . Iona Costello's husband George, the co-owner of Costello Marine in Greenport, died from a heart attack in 2012 . Police questioned mother and daughter and now consider the case closed after releasing them. Iona called her mother at 3:30 a.m. on Monday morning to tell her she was ok. 'I'm thankful my daughter is safe. She's had a lot of pressure,' Iona's mother, Diana Malcolmson, told the New York Daily News. 'She just wanted to get away.' Iona claimed she had no idea friends and family members were worried about her sudden disappearance, her mother said. 'She hadn't listened to the news. She didn't know she was causing all this trouble,' Malcolmson said. Iona is in the midst of a nasty battle over the will of her husband, George Costello Sr., 63, who died of a heart attack as he was working on a Southampton barge on Dec. 28, 2012. News of Iona's reappearance comes after more details emerged about the colorful background of her late husband's family, who were in dispute with her over the contents of Mr Costello's will. It was revealed that the mother's stepson has a long criminal record and was jailed again just days after she disappeared, a report suggests. George Costello Jr is currently in jail in Florida on apparently unrelated charges and has been described by relatives as a 'mixed-up' kid.' British-born Mrs Costello and Emily were visiting Manhattan when they went missing on March 30 near their home in the the wealthy seaside village of Greenport. Their car was found in a parking garage on 42nd street in Manhattan, but the pair, who often went into the city for theater and art museums, left no other trace of their whereabouts. Iona's husband died in 2012 from a heart attack, and she is believed to have been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. The New York Daily News reported Iona's stepson Costello Jr, 45, was visiting Hamptons Bay, New York, at the time, and relatives said he has never got on with the family. He has a long history of drug arrests and is currently in Palm Beach Detention Center following an arrest for a 'domestic dispute' when he returned to Florida. His fiance, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the Daily News  it was a 'weird coincidence', but insists she was with him the whole time. Speaking from the prison, he told the newspaper he was visiting his Hampton Bay home at the time and flew home on April 1, two days after the pair went missing. George Jr, who has at least 10 arrests to his name, according to court records, says he didn't have a close relationship with Iona. He said the last time the pair spoke was at his father and her husband's funeral. Police reportedly told Iona's mother there is surveillance video of them leaving a parking garage laughing . Iona's brother-in-law John Costello (right), is facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. Costello's stepson, George Costello Jr (left), 45,  has a long history of drug arrests (mugshot from April) 'She's a hardworking lady who loves her horses and takes care of them really well. She's a good mother,' he told the Daily News. Iona's mother, Diana Malcomson, had also insisted George Jr wouldn't want to harm the pair, but said he was a 'mixed-up kid'. Her brother-in-law is also facing a criminal case. John Costello is  facing vehicular manslaughter charges after he allegedly drove his pickup truck into oncoming traffic last December in Greenport, New York. They were reported missing by relatives of the 'quiet Irish family', who own a horse farm on Long Island's North Fork. Iona, who was her late husband George's third wife and inherited his entire estate along with her daughter, had been 'under a lot of stress' because of a legal battle with four of his five adult children from previous marriages. 'She can't sell anything. She can't do anything because everything is in court,' an unidentified relative told the New York Daily News. 'I don't know if she's having a nervous breakdown. I don't know if somebody has kidnapped them,' the unidentified family member said of the Costellos' long absence from their home and farm. Costello's adult children have argued that the will granting the estate to Iona was improperly executed, according to Novick Law Group. A Long Island court sided with the adult children last year, and Iona Costello is appealing. Amanda Hurwitz, one of George's daughters who now lives in Connecticut, refused to comment to Daily Mail Online on the report or her stepmother's disappearance. The widow's trip into New York was originally only supposed to last for several days. 'She said she was going to Manhattan for Easter,' Iona's mother Diana Malcolmson, 80, told Daily Mail Online. The grandmother, who lives in nearby Shelter Island, New York, said police told her that surveillance footage from the parking garage showed Mrs Costello and Emily walking away from their car on March 30, holding suitcases and laughing. She said that she spoke regularly with her daughter, but had not heard about any plans for extended vacations. While trips into New York were fairly normal, Emily being out of school is not. The ninth grader had been scheduled to return to Ross School in East Hampton from her Spring Break this past Tuesday. The mother had told workers at her farm that she would be 'back on Tuesday' but did not return on March 31st, April 7th or April 14th. Workers at the horse farm said earlier it was strange for Mrs Costello not to be in contact with them about raising the animals. Southold police Chief of Police Martin Flatley told Daily Mail Online  his force did not suspect foul play. Relative Jane Costello said that calls to both Iona's and Emily's phones had gone straight to voicemail. Mrs Costello's family have lived in both the UK and the US, but she is British by birth. Her mother Diana and late father Euan, a stockbroker, lived in Stow in the Wold, Gloucestershire before setting sail for North America in 1958 aboard the Liberte cruise ship. Their plan was to live in Canada but they instead moved to Long Island. The couple returned to the UK at some point and records indicate that Mrs Costello was born in Marylebone in Central London, as was her brother Andrew. Mrs Costello's aunt Gwendoline Preston married Lord William Wynne-Jones, a renowned chemist and former vice-chancellor of Newcastle University.","Iona Costello, 51, and daughter Emily went missing on March 30 .

A father was asked to leave a Wetherspoon pub for a family breakfast with his wife and stepdaughter because he was wearing tracksuit bottoms. David Curry, 49, had travelled ten miles from  home to visit The Wallow in Blyth, Northumberland, for the first time with wife Vee, 45, and her daughter Kayleigh. But when the family arrived Mr Curry was told he could not stay in the pub because he was wearing a pair of £40 Adidas trousers. The pub chain has apologised to Mr Curry, from Ashington, but said a no-tracksuit policy had been in place at the bar since 2013. 'I go to my local Wetherspoon pub in Ashington all the time wearing track suit bottoms and we have never been denied entry,' said Mr Curry. 'We decided to go to this one instead for a change of scene. 'We had just walked in and were just about to go to the bar when a waiter said ""excuse me you have got to leave, you are wearing track suit bottoms"". 'I couldn't believe it. I just had to laugh and walk away.' Instead, the family travelled back to Ashington and went to a nearby pub for Sunday lunch. Self-employed builder Mr Curry said he often wears sportswear as part of a health regime that saw him shed 17 stone through exercise and giving up alcohol. He had been drinking 25 pints a day and ballooned to 28 stone, but changed his ways and started running up to 20 miles a day after being told he would die if he did not lose weight. Teaching assistant Mrs Curry said the pub chain has lost money by turning the family away at the door. 'I said you are joking! We had just come for our breakfast. When Mr Curry arrived at the pub with his wife and stepdaughter he was told he could not order a drink because of his attire . 'Dave was wearing a pair of £40 trousers, they weren't cheap.

23276e51baad3d935ed5fd3c2c0e24d84ee3e046,"ALL DAY LONG . By Joanna Biggs . (Serpent’s Tail £14.99) Famously and memorably, the poet Philip Larkin asked: 'Why should I let the toad work / Squat on my life?' He longed to be '... courageous enough / To shout Stuff your pension! - but knew he never would. Coffee morning: Britain at work . The tyranny of the nine-to-five is about money (of course), but also about moral worth: we work because we know we should 'pull our weight' in society's tug-of-war. On any morning, in any town or city all over the world, people stream into their places of work, some driven by a sense of vocation, some by resigned boredom, some by greed, some by need. Surely it is work, not love, which makes the world go round? Joanna Biggs offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis (thank goodness), but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country. Reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the Sixties with no worries about finding a job. We were lucky. Joanna Biggs makes it bleakly clear that for many people today, 'the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds'. Biggs divides her workers in interesting categories, yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function. So the 'Making' chapter gives us a potter, a shoemaker and (yes) a robot, which introduces us to its maintenance engineers. 'Serving' includes a sex worker, two baristas, a call centre adviser and a political special adviser. Those 'Repairing' are a rabbi, an Army major and a nurse, while those 'Leading' are a company director, a stay-at-home mum (inspired, that one) and a hereditary lord. Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me' The scope of the book is broad. We meet those who are selling, entertaining, thinking, caring - as well as a curious clutch of people Biggs lumps together under 'Starting': a goldsmith's apprentice (one of my favourites), a rebellious intern, an entrepreneur specialising in 'start-up' technologies, an unemployed graduate. There's also a 56-year-old man on Mandatory Work Activity, usually known as 'workfare' - the Government initiative designed for those on Jobseeker's Allowance, to help them 'gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work... while at the same time making a contribution to the community'. Joanna Biggs clearly does not think very much of 'workfare': in fact, it's clear she despises the scheme. Here, although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect, I wish she hadn't editorialised so overtly. I really wanted to hear more about what John thought of his life. A book which aims to give the reader much-needed insight into other people's lives (and it certainly does that) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader: 'A citizen's income set at the right level - £320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low-paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the UK.' At that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy, with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met. ALL DAY LONG By Joanna Biggs . In the Seventies I was a huge admirer of the work of America's Studs Terkel and England's Tony Parker, both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice, by using recorded interviews, carefully transcribed, with no questions included and no comment or judgment. It was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly (and sometimes shockingly) into the hearts and minds of prisoners, drifters, miners, people on a housing estate, and so on. You felt you got to know them without the author-interviewer standing in the way - although, of course, all interviews have to be edited. Joanna Biggs invokes Terkel: 'I've often wondered what (he) would think of how we think about work now.' Well, I reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard, without surprise, and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould. In contrast, Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me: it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand, and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other.' At the end, she lays her cards on the table, confessing that as she listened to people's stories, 'I most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it's organised now.' That's the trouble with the workers, you see. They've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life, turning their backs on revolution.","Joanna Biggs tells the stories of real people she has interviewedin the UK .

The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday. It said it will still show the Oscar-nominated movie but with an educational forum follow-up to allow students to discuss the film. Bradley Cooper in his Oscar Nominated role as Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper in US military history . The Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (pictured) in New York has pushed back its planned screening of the controversial Iraq war film which was set for last Friday . The film was postponed because senior management at the college did not want to create animosity or tension among its students. However they appear to have done just the opposite. Following complaints from the RPI’s Muslim Students’ Association a number of students have said the postponement was an act of censorship and an attack on free speech, Fox News reported. While the film grossed a total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis . A statement from the university explained the aim of the screening, coupled with the now scheduled educational forum, was to allow students in the campus community to ‘participate in an intellectual discourse about the film and current world events’. American Sniper, a film by Clint Eastwood about US Navy Seal sharp-shooter Chris Kyle the most deadly sniper in US history, has courted controversy since it was first shown in the US in November. While the film grossed an international total of $540 million it also drew criticism for its depiction of Iraqis. It was also accused of stoking racial hatred after screenings of the film led to a rise in threats against Americans of Middle Eastern origin and even some attacks on Muslims outside movie theaters. Earlier this month the University of Michigan flip-flopped over whether or not it would show the film on its campus. The college pulled a screening over student complaints but quickly did an about-face after news of the cancellation sparked a firestorm on campus. The school released statement saying the decision to cancel had not been consistent with the high value it placed on freedom of expression. Navy Seal and Iraq war veteran Chris Kyle, depicted in the film, was killed at a shooting range in Texas . The school's vice president for student life, E. Royster Harper, acknowledged that it was ‘a mistake’ to call off the screening. ‘The movie will be shown at the originally scheduled time and location,’ Harper’s statement read. ‘We recognize, however, that some students are uncomfortable with the content of the movie, and appreciate that concern.’ An Alternative screening of the Paddington Bear movie was offered to those students who did not want to watch the American Sniper.

On stage: The former child star recently appeared in a West End play and admitted she felt like the UK press treated her with respect . Lindsay, who found fame in The Parent Trap when she was just 11 years old, added that she is 'much happier' in the city and is keen to build on that feeling of contentment in order to get her career back on track, after becoming better known in recent years for her off-screen antics more than her on-screen talents. Indeed, the time that she has spent in London has given her pause for thought – and possibly a much-needed break from the Hollywood grind. 'I find that UK press is much more politically based. Where American press is much more focused on celebrities,' she explained. 'Especially when doing a West End play, it’s a different respect that you hope to gain.' I don’t place myself in the same ""situations"" as I used to. It also comes with time and age.' New leaf? Lindsay says she no longer finds herself in the 'situations' she became famous for off-screen . Stripped: The 28-year-old posed in sexy lingerie for men's fashion magazine Homme Style. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip,' she said . Saucy: Lindsay was more than comfortable to pose up in the luxurious lingerie . Lindsay added that London now feels like her real home and she insists she has no regrets about leaving Los Angeles, saying 'I don't need to see it all over again. The last time I went to LA it was my friend’s birthday and we went to this karaoke place. 'It was the same people, the same faces, nothing had changed. It felt very un-evolved.' As well as sitting down for an interview with Homme Style, which was curated by Akmal Shaukat, Lindsay also posed up for a provocative and risqué shoot with renowned fashion photographer Rankin, for which she donned several pieces of saucy lingerie – something, she revealed, she was more than comfortable doing. 'I do love lingerie,' she confessed. 'Lace is always the best, and I feel beautiful in a night slip. It’s fun to be girly and womanly.' The Mean Girls star was due to finish her probation for a reckless driving charge last month, however she was ordered to complete another 125 hours of community service after she tried to pass off the time she spent performing on stage in London as 'volunteering'. Out and about: Lindsay has been spotted on the town around London attending various premieres and fashion events . Talk of the town: Lindsay tweeted this selfie on Friday intended to show off the results of her new 'waist-training' corset, but her followers accused the star of editing her curves . Last week, Lindsay was forced to deny that she is enjoying a romance with British reality star Jake Hall. According to UK newspaper The Sun, it was alleged the handsome star first went out with the Mean Girls actress in February and that they've been in contact ever since, but any rumors of a tryst between the pair has since been denied by the Hollywood star's representative. 'It is not true,' the spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Online. And Jake himself has also denied that they are in a romance, adding that they are just friends. He told Daily Mail Online: 'We were not dating: we are friends.'","Lindsay, 28, moved to the UK last spring before making her London stage debut .

'Our target is to get through this round and reach the semi-finals, and if we qualify 1-0 or 1-1 (on aggregate), that's all the same to me,' said Allegri, whose side are at home in the quarter-final first leg on Tuesday. 'It could be a boring game, the important thing is not to concede a goal at home.' Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri strolls in to his pre-match press conference on Monday . The Juventus squad look relaxed as they are put through their paces in sunny Turin . Allegri warned that Monaco, who have conceded only four goals in eight games on their way to the quarter-finals, would be a completely different proposition to Borussia Dortmund, who Juventus beat 5-1 on aggregate in the last 16. 'The tie against Monaco is much more complicated than the one against Dortmund,' he said. 'They are two very different teams, the French side concede few goals and it's always more complicated to play against a team that doesn't go forward very often. Veteran midfielder Andrea Pirlo has returned to training after a calf injury . Claudio Marchisio looks focused as he engages in a training drill on Monday . Arturo Vidal (left) and Fernando Llorente will both be hoping to start in the Champions League quarter-final . 'It's tempting to go forward ourselves and there is the risk of leaving spaces for them. We need patience, humility and intelligence, and to realise that we are not going to settle qualification in Turin. 'I think they (Monaco) have richly deserved to get to the quarter finals,' added Allegri. 'They conceded one goal in six games during the group stage, eliminating Benfica and Zenit St Petersburg. In Ligue 1, they have the best defence with 22 goals conceded (in 32 games). These figures do not come by chance.' Experienced defender Giorgio Chiellini smiles as he talks to the media on Monday afternoon . Allegri said that playmaker Andrea Pirlo had been included in the squad after recovering from a calf muscle injury, and he now had to decide whether the 35-year-old could be plunged into the tie after a seven-week lay-off. 'Pirlo hasn't played for more than 40 days, I'll decide after the last training session,' he said.","Juventus take on Monaco in Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday .

Sturridge will again be absent for Tuesday night's trip to Hull and while Rodgers will not take the drastic step of calling time on his campaign, he remains unsure whether the England international will play again this season. The 25-year-old missed five months with calf and thigh issues and he is now battling to overcome a hip problem that was sustained in the 2-1 defeat to Manchester United on March 22. Daniel Sturridge may not play again this season because of a series of calf and thigh injuries . Sturridge will miss Liverpool's trip to face Hull City on Tuesday night because of injury problems . Rodgers concedes it has been a difficult year for Sturridge but maintains Liverpool's medical department will continue to nurse him back to full fitness; the manager is also determined to bring in players to ease the burden on him next season. 'It had been difficult for Daniel,' said Rodgers. 'He wants to work and play. We are just going to have to monitor it. He is a good lad and when he had been fit, he has been brilliant for us. 'He is not available, we will do what is in the best interest of him. He is going to be here for the next number of years. 'There are always names associated. It is certainly something that we need to address. Daniel is top class but we need to give him help. 'You are nearly talking about a 100 per cent deficit. We have had 14 clean sheets. That side of the game has been addressed but we need to improve the critical area.' Manchester United's defeat at Everton on Sunday has, in the words of Louis van Gaal, given Liverpool 'a glimmer of light' in the race for the top four and United's advantage could be down to one point by the time they next play.

353782941658f1ef7042ae65e0cd1057287065eb,"Brian Williams started embellishing his stories because he felt insecure following in Tom Brokaw's very large footsteps at NBC, according to a new report. The network handed Williams a six-month suspension in February after he acknowledged he had lied about being on board a helicopter that came under fire while reporting from Iraq in 2003. But according to a report in Vanity Fair, Williams started exaggerating his stories because he felt insecure about Brokaw, whom he succeeded at Nightly News in 2004. 'I always felt he needed to jack up his stories because he was trying so hard to overcome his insecurities,' one executive told the publication. Clash: Tom Brokaw and Brian Williams are pictured in New York in 2004 - the year Williams took over Brokaw's role on the Nightly News. A new report has claimed Williams always felt insecure following him . 'And he had to follow Tom, which brought its own set of insecurities. He likes to sort of tell these grandiose tales... I just saw it as one of the quirks of his personality.' But according to former correspondents who spoke to Vanity Fair, Brokaw wasn't so accepting of the 'quirks'. The stories left him 'incensed', the publication reported. On one occasion, Williams implied they had both been in Berlin together on the day the wall fell in 1989 - but he actually joined the veteran newscaster there the following day. On hearing the tale, Brokaw went into 'spasms of anger', one former exec told Vanity Fair. 'Tom treated that anchor chair as a public trust,' a former employee said. 'He really was our Walter Cronkite.' Others said that the two men had a troubled relationship after Williams took over the role because even though Brokaw pushed for him to get the job, Williams never 'embraced' him. 'I don't know why,' a source said. '[Williams] knows the rank and file will never love him like they did Tom, so he never tries. That's the reason there's not a lot of support for Brian over there.' Exaggerations: During a report in February, pictured, Williams recounted a tale of how he had been on a Chinook that came under fire while in Iraq in 2003 - but he had actually been in a separate aircraft . It also meant that when Williams found himself in hot water over his claim he had been in a downed Chinook - when he had actually been in a separate aircraft - Brokaw didn't have his back. A friend told the publication that while Brokaw - who was 'livid' about the scandal - didn't call for Williams to be punished, he 'didn't try to save him either.' Following the suspension, Williams reportedly declared to a friend: 'Chalk one up for Brokaw.' Not impressed: Brokaw, pictured in February, came 'incensed' when he heard Williams' exaggerations . The article also claimed that when he was called out for lying in his reports and conversations following the 2003 helicopter incident, Williams couldn't bring himself to admit he had made it up - and instead, he suggested he might have a brain tumor. '(He said,) 'Did something happen to (my) head? Maybe I had a brain tumor, or something in my head',' a source said. 'He just didn't know. We just didn't know. We had no clear sense what had happened. We got the best (apology) we could get.' When it came to uncovering the truth behind what actually happened in the 2003 helicopter incident, NBC quickly learned Williams himself would be of no help. 'He was having a tough enough time coming to grips with the idea that he had gotten it wrong in the first place, slash misrepresented it, slash lied,' one insider said. Others suggested that the problem with Williams' work was because the newscaster, who had never been a war or foreign correspondent before taking over at Nightly News, had no interest in reporting on war stories or 'heavy' news and lacked the experience of his predecessors. His appearance on late-night talk shows and comedy series, such as 30 Rock, suggested that instead of getting into gritty news, he actually wanted his own talk show, Vanity Fair suggested. While some NBC employees say this diversity was admirable and something his predecessors had never mastered, others say it did not go down well with the network. 'He didn't want to leave New York,' one source said. 'Getting him to war zones was real tough... but when he did go, he came back with these great stories that kind of put himself at the center of things.' In February, Williams was forced to admit that he wasn't aboard the helicopter that was hit and forced down by enemy fire in Iraq in 2003  - a story he had often repeated over the past 12 years. 'Overwhelmed': Sources told Vanity Fair that Williams, pictured in Iraq, did not want to report on 'hard' news and didn't enjoy politics or war stories, and lacked the experience of his predecessors . Lies: During a report in 2003, he reported how a Chinook, pictured, had been grounded but he later claimed he had been aboard the aircraft that was shot down. In fact, he was on one about 30 minutes behind . It came after he claimed on the Nightly News in January that his aircraft had been hit, causing outrage from the soldiers who had actually been involved. Crew members on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit by two rockets and small arms fire had told Stars and Stripes that the NBC anchor was nowhere near the aircraft or two other Chinooks that had been flying in formation when they took fire. According to the crew members, Williams arrived about an hour later on another helicopter after the other three had made an emergency landing. Even though Williams learned about the uproar over his false story on Facebook, he failed to bring it up with NBC execs when he met with them the next day, suggesting deeper flaws within the network and its relationship with staff, former employees told Vanity Fair. Days after the false report, he acknowledged the lie as he spoke to a reporter. 'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.' While Williams initially believed he'd be back to work within days, he was ultimately suspended for six months, and he accepted that he had to step back, sources said. NBC Nightly News is now being anchored by Lester Holt and it is unclear if Williams will return. Questions: A number of Williams' seemingly outlandish claims also came under scrutiny . Red Bank, New Jersey, 1970s . In a 2011 interview, Brian Williams recalled his time as a teenage volunteer firefighter during which he saved a puppy. But in a 2005 Esquire interview, Williams said he saved two puppies. In the same Esquire interview, Williams also revealed he had been mugged at gunpoint while selling Christmas trees in the sleepy New Jersey town in which he grew up. A number of locals have questioned the credibility of his claim that someone 'stuck a .38-caliber in my face'. Iraq War, 2003 . Over the years, Williams has told multiple versions of a story about being in an Army Chinook helicopter during the Iraq War in 2003. Earlier this year, he claimed his helicopter was hit by ground fire, an allegation he was later forced to admit was false after an outcry from soldiers who were present. Williams issued an on-air apology and wrote on Facebook: 'Nobody's trying to steal anyone's valor.' He was later suspended over the incident. Hurricane Katrina, 2005 . Williams has told several stories about his experiences reporting from New Orleans. He has claimed to have seen a dead body float past the window of his hotel in the city's French Quarter – even though the area wasn't flooded. The accuracy of other Katrina claims, including that he caught dysentery drinking the flood waters and that his hotel was 'overrun' with gangs, have been called into question by others who were on the ground during the disaster. Israel, 2006 . In a 2007 interview with Fairfield University Student Television, Williams recalled 'Katyusha rockets passing just underneath the helicopter I was riding in' during a trip to Israel. In fact he was nowhere near enemy fire and in a broadcast segment filmed that day he described rocket fire 'six miles away'. Boston, 2006 . A Navy vet accused Williams of lying to skip an event honoring members of the Armed Forces so that he could appear on Saturday Night Live. On the day of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society event the NBC News anchor told organizers that a 'pressing engagement' meant he wouldn't be able speak at the dinner, but later that evening he appeared in a walk-on role on SNL's Weekend Update.","Williams was suspended  from NBC in February after it emerged he'd lied about being in a helicopter that was shot down in Iraq in 2003 .

3d949acfd29875e1ec4059ba371b2bcc14e5a81e,"A 33-year-old woman on trial for having sex with a male inmate at Washington County Jail six times in four months while working as a services technician is hoping to use an insanity defense, claiming she was 'vulnerable, passive and gullible' and suffers from mental illness. Brett Robinson is facing 12 charges related to sexual misconduct and official misconduct after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell multiple times and engaging in sex acts  between March and July last year. The case follows that of her colleague Lisa Curry, 39, who last month was sentenced to over four years prison for repeatedly having sex with a 25-year-old gang member and convicted rapist. Robinson, who worked in a maximum security control room known as 'the bubble', struck up a relationship with the inmate - who has not been named -  in a nearby cell. The two would talk using an intercom when Robinson's manager left the room. 'Gullible': Brett Robinson, 32, is facing 12 charges after allegedly letting the inmate out of his cell at Washington County Jail and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year . Charged: Robinson allegedly brought the male inmate into the control where she worked at Washing County Jail and had sex with him on his birthday under a blanket . According to a psychologist's report obtained by Oregon Live, Robinson felt flattered by the compliments she got from the inmate and started to 'open up to him' early last year. Then, in March, the inmate asked for a kiss on his birthday. When her manager went to lunch, Robinson released the inmate from his cell and brought him into the bubble. She thought it strange that he brought a blanket with him from the cell, the report said. 'He kissed me so passionately, I was taken aback. 'I asked about the blanket. 'He said ''I was hoping we could go farther''. 'Then he was saying ''we don't have time to discuss this'', so I had sex with him.' They continued having sexual encounters, the report said, and Robinson wrote the inmate a love letter that began with 'Hi Baby'. The letter said: 'I am hoping this letter will better convey the love I feel deep inside for you. ... You are a constant presence in my thoughts, fantasies and dreams, and I feel this pervasive emptiness without you by my side. It makes it hard to go about my normal daily activities when all I do is miss you. You are my everything, Baby – I could not envision my life without you in it.' New protocol: In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . On trial: Brett Robinson, 33, faces charges of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and first-degree official misconduct . However the relationship began to sour when Robinson started hearing about the abusive conduct of the inmate elsewhere in the prison. He had passed a sexually explicit note to a nurse and also pushed a female prisoner against a wall and kissed her. The psychologist noted that Robinson was delusional about the man. The report also said she had struggled with depression and anxiety since childhood. 'There is evidence that these delusions developed in this generally vulnerable, passive and gullible woman as part of a Major Depressive and Anxiety episode,' the doctor wrote. Robinson was caught when the inmate brought up their relationship to a prison employee during an investigation about Jill Curry. The prosecution is fighting against Robinson using the insanity defense. In March Curry was sentenced to four years and two months prison. That case was very similar to the allegations against Robinson. Curry was also a services technician and was convicted of letting gang member Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25,  who was housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, out of his cell and have sex with him in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cries in court last month as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in the supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation when sentencing Curry. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release.

e0a5406bd964ee77d6af8079972138d3972179bb,"Tony Pulis returned to Selhurst Park for the first time since he left Crystal Palace and masterminded a victory which pulled his West Bromwich Albion side to the edge of safety. Alan Pardew tried new ideas on the pitch to outwit Pulis but an early goal from James Morrison and stunner from Craig Gardner meant he could not deliver a satisfying result against the man who left Palace two days before this season kicked off. Despite the timing of his departure, however, there was very little bad blood between Palace’s fans and Pulis who was roundly applauded as he came out from the tunnel in the corner of a ground where the seats are close to the pitch and the crowd can be unforgiving. A few boos broke the surface, but they were drowned out by waves of the respect he deserved for saving them from relegation last season, during his 10-month tenure, when he won the Premier League LMA Manager of the Year award. West Brom midfielder Craig Gardner celebrates having scored the second for Tony Pulis' side with a fine long ranged effort .

It has got unbelievable potential and I mean that. The supporters are wonderful and they have a good manager. They can push on – if Alan is given the money and the opportunity to push this club forward this club could be a good club.’ Yannick Bolasie even made the effort to go over and shake Pulis’ hand as he strolled down the touchline. Yet the south London locals would not have been expecting what came within two minutes of kick off when West Brom took the lead. Chris Bunt swung in a corner from the left and James Morrison managed to lose Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon and nod in, completely free, from five yards out. Some of Puncheon’s team-mates looked around in disbelief that the West Brom man was afforded so much space in the box. ‘That was a weakness in our set up that Tony exploited,’ Pardew admitted. ‘It was well worked. Their guy took Puncheon to the edge of the box where he is not comfortable marking. ‘We knew Tony would know the players well, know the strengths and weaknesses, I tried to throw a few ideas in on the pitch. They didn’t come off. Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie greets former Eagles boss Tony Pulis (right) before kick-off at Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon .

People know Tony does an honest job, he plays the game his way and we respect that.’ Despite that early set back, however, Crystal Palace started to play the eye-catching football that has made Pardew so popular in these parts during his short spell in charge. And it was all coming through their main man, Bolasie, on the left. In the 24th minute he weaved into the box, played a one-two then poked an effort towards the near post which West Brom goalkeeper Boaz Myhill did well to save with his feet. Three minutes later he cut in from his flank and bent an effort towards the far corner that Myhill clawed out. Then, just after the half-hour, a ball came in from the opposite flank from Joel Ward, was headed on by Glenn Murray and Bolasie executed a sublime bicycle kick, only to be denied by Myhill once again. If Pulis, dressed in his usual full tracksuit, trainers and cap on the touchline, provided this Crystal Palace team with the spine and solidity to compete in the top flight, Pardew, resplendent in suit and tie, has given them the suave and flair to delight. In this instance, Pulis’ resilient style prevailed and against the run of play they added a second on 53 minutes. The ball came out from a West Brom corner and Gardner took a touch before, 30 yards out and slightly to the right of goal, he buried a right-foot strike over Julian Speroni into the left of goal. It is almost mission accomplished for Pulis at West Brom as they moved to 36 points and put a healthy gap between themselves and the bottom three.

Alice Barker snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen. Barker had danced at legendary clubs like the Apollo, Cotton Club and Zanzibar Club, and had appeared in movies commercials and television shows. This is the moment 102-year-old Alice Barker, who used to dance with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, got to see herself shimmy and shake on film for the first time . Barker (pictured far right in the video) snapped her fingers and sang along as videos of her routines as a chorus line dancer during the 1930s Harlem Renaissance played on the screen . But she had never gotten the chance to watch herself dance. She didn't even have any photographs or memorabilia to remember her years on stage. It was David Shuff, who met Barker years ago when he brought his therapy dog to her retirement home, that finally reunited the one-time famous dancer with her videos. After a long and unsuccessful first search, Shuff connected with Mark Cantor, a collector of short musical films called 'soundies' who runs the online archive Jazz on Film. It was then Shuff and Cantor discovered that Barker's videos were filed under 'Baker', a misspelling of her name - which was why no one had been able to find them before, according to Mashable. They located three of Barker's soundies, giving her the chance to finally watch her days in the chorus line, where she was almost always in the front row. 'Don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing,' Barker sang along as she watched one of her routines. When Shuff asked her how many years she danced, Barker replied 'that's all I ever did, that was it!' She said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again'.

Barker found herself needing to dance and move to  music at a young age. She told Shuff a story about when she was a child and her mother was preparing her for a bath. Her mother had gone to the house to retrieve something when a young Barker heard a band play nearby. 'When she came back I was gone,' said Barker. 'I was down there naked just going, dancing.' 'And then, if the band would stop playing, I'd look at them and ""come on, let's get it going, let's get it going here.""' Barker said said the videos made her wish she could get out of bed and 'do it all over again' But the most special part for Barker was getting to watch herself dance again. 'I used to often say to myself, I am being paid to do something that I enjoy doing and I would do it for free,' she said . Shuff shared Barker's story on Reddit, where he wrote that the videos were now in her possession and that they are often played in her retirement center's communal room, noting that she's a 'rock star these days'. He added that Barker knows her videos are online now and that it made her happy because she 'feels connected to the world again'.

The 4th District Court of Appeal in San Diego upheld a lower court ruling that tossed out a family's lawsuit trying to block the Encinitas Union School District from teaching yoga as an alternative to traditional gym classes. The lawsuit brought by Stephen and Jennifer Sedlock and their two children claimed the school district's yoga classes promoted Hinduism and inhibited Christianity. Scroll down for video . Students hold their positions during a yoga class at Capri Elementary School in Encinitas, California, in 2012 . A California appeals court ruled yoga classes taught at Capri do not violate students' right to religious freedom . The court upheld the previous ruling in a 3-0 opinion. The district court wrote: 'While the practice of yoga may be religious in some contexts, yoga classes as taught in the district are, as the trial court determined, ""devoid of any religious, mystical, or spiritual trappings."" 'We conclude that the program is secular in purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion and does not excessively entangle the school district in religion. 'The district's yoga program does not violate our state constitution.' The First Amendment bans school-sponsored religious promotion and prayer. Yoga instructor Kristen McCloskey (right) leads third graders at Olivenhain Pioneer Elementary School in 2012 . The Sedlocks were disappointed with the ruling and are considering their options. Attorney Dean Broyles said: 'No other court in the past 50 years has allowed public school officials to lead children in formal religious rituals like the Hindu liturgy of praying to, bowing to, and worshipping the sun god.' A school distort lawyer said there were no rituals occurring in the classroom and no one was worshipping the sun or leading Hindu rites. The district said the practice is taught in a secular way to promote strength, flexibility and balance. Yoga is now taught at schools across the country, but the district is believed to be the first with full-time yoga teachers at all schools. A three-year grant from the K.P. Jois Foundation, a nonprofit group that promotes Ashtanga yoga, provides twice-weekly, 30-minute classes to the district's 5,600 students.

Dave Doggett, the chairman of Cambridge United, has warned of a new breed of hooliganism and believes groups of up to 10 men - aged in their 50s and 60s - are trying to relive the 1980s by arranging fights with rivals . Mr Doggett said violence at matches has increased recently as older men return to watching their team play in their retirement and fears there is a danger that they will try to encourage younger fans to join their 'gangs' Writing in his club's latest programme, Mr Doggett said: 'Unfortunately football clubs still attract an undesirable element of society that appear determined to ruin the enjoyment of real supporters of football clubs. 'Our promotion to the Football League appears to have encouraged our ""risk"" from the 1980s to come out of retirement. 'Many of them are grandparents trying to encourage the next generation to join their ""gangs"". 'It sounds pathetic but unfortunately it is reality. We are working closely with police. 'Hopefully the reality of the potential consequences will dissuade some of our younger supporters from becoming involved with these undesirables. 'Our football club is too important to so many to allow a few to ruin our great sport.' Peter Woor, a Cambridge United fan, said he had noticed that the hooliganism of the 1970s and 1980s still lingers in games against local rivals such as Southend United and Luton Town. He said: 'There's a tension and you feel threatened so I don't go to those places anymore. It's not worth it. 'Most places are fine though, but you still tend to go to away games and keep your colours hidden. 'I remember the 1970s and 1980s and it was horrendous and of course it's nothing like that but it's still a problem. 'These people must have something missing in their lives to want to do this. It's very sad.' Cambridge supporter Simon Dobbin, 42 (pictured with wife Nicole), remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after an away game to Southend on March 21. Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' Mr Doggett said older men were those causing violence. Pictured: Police with fans following reports of disorder outside Southend's Spread Eagle pub prior to the recent match between the Essex side and Cambridge . One Cambridge season ticket holder, who asked not to be named, said a group of about 30 fans regularly turn up to games looking for trouble afterwards. He said: 'They arrive after the game starts and then leave before it finishes to find a fight.' Cambridge United supporter Simon Dobbin, 42, remains in a medically-induced coma since being attacked after their game away to Southend on March 21. Essex Police said he was an 'entirely innocent victim' and believe he was set upon by a group of thugs intent on attacking the visiting Cambridge fans. Cambridgeshire Police said the force has also seen an increase in the 'severity and volume' of football-related disorder this season. Inspector Steve Kerridge said: 'We have seen an increase in football-related violence and disorder amongst a very small minority of people, both in Cambridge and other locations when the club has travelled. 'The tragic events recently leading to a serious injury in Southend have been reported widely and sicken us all. Mr Doggett said Cambridge United had noticed an increase in violence since the club was promoted to League Two last year. Pictured: Southend United's Barry Corr beats Richard Tait to the ball in last month's match . 'The club is working hard with us to ensure that those who use football as a vehicle for violence and disorder have no place in the terraces or association with Cambridge United.' He said police are using football banning orders, which impose 'stringent court-backed' restrictions on individuals. He added: 'The increase of risk activity both in severity and volume this season means regular consideration of this level of intervention is once again - and sadly - justified and necessary.' The warning comes as football chiefs across the country continue to promote the Kick It Out Season of Action campaign to promote respect within football.","Cambridge United chairman warning of rise of violence among older fans .

She helped tend to survivors and those gravely injured before rescue helicopters arrived to get people off the mountainside . Survivor Dr Gallant said she and an Indian doctor rushed to help the injured in difficult conditions following the avalanche, including the gravely-ill Sherpa, but said there was nothing they could do to save his life. 'I was outside, saw this huge blast coming down', she told ABC News. 'I ran into the tent, threw myself on the floor. When the vibration stopped, I went out and radioed over to the medical tent. 'They asked me and an Indian climber (a doctor in the Indian army) to take care of head injuries. 'We worked through the night, doing rounds, handing out medication, putting in IVs. 'Of the nine patients, one of them died last night — a 25-year-old Sherpa. His blood pressure had fallen. There was nothing we could do.'

ff7322e2f21e93644de0a134b51d8959f28cacde,"Celtic's Treble dream died on Sunday with striker Leigh Griffiths pointing the finger of blame squarely at the officials after his side's shock Scottish Cup semi-final defeat by Inverness. A blatant Josh Meekings handball in the box was missed by referee Steven McLean and his team, particularly assistant Alan Muir, at the end of the first half with the Parkhead club left to rue the decision not to award a penalty and dispense a red card. A goal down at the time, Inverness fought back and eventually emerged victorious following a pulsating period of extra-time and the Celtic players could do little to hide their fury after the match. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths has a shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness . Griffiths heads the ball, which is deflected clearly off the hand of Inverness' Josh Meekings (left) on Sunday . Despite numerous appeals, no penalty or red card was given for Meekings' handball and Inverness won . 'We have a lot of disappointed lads inside that dressing room — we've been robbed,' said Griffiths who, more than an hour after the final whistle, was still struggling to contain his own disbelief and anger. 'It was very disappointing. We had a chance to go and make history. We didn't get the result in the end.' Celtic were a Virgil van Dijk goal to the good at the time of the Meekings incident but the game was then turned on its head in the second half as Celtic goalkeeper Craig Gordon was sent off for a foul on Marley Watkins. Greg Tansey equalised with the resultant spot-kick and suddenly John Hughes' men were in ascendancy. With the teams level at full-time, Edward Ofere and John Guidetti swapped goals in extra-time before David Raven grabbed a 117th-minute winner — leaving the Highlanders jubilant and their opponents distraught. Parkhead manager Ronny Deila had insisted he need not say anything about the penalty incident. Scott Brown, meanwhile, stalked past with a face like thunder, lightning and Force 10 hurricane all rolled into one angry swirling mass, damned near taking the door off its hinges as he made a dramatic exit from the depths of the national stadium. 'I have asked the centre-half in the second half if it has hit his hand or his face - and he said it hit his hand 100 per cent, so in my book that's a penalty and a red card,' continued Griffiths. 'We have probably the best penalty taker in the league in Kris Commons, who I am sure would go and tuck it away to put us 2-0 up. They'd have been down to 10 men and it would have been a mountain for them to come back. Celtic's Aleksandar Tonev (centre) is challenged by Marley Watkins (left) and Edward Ofere (right) on Sunday . Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) has words with referee Steven McLean during the Scottish Cup semi-final . 'I knew it was a penalty. I think everyone in the ground knew it was a penalty. The second half has been very lucky. 'He is the one who said it hit him in the face (the additional assistant ref). I asked the ref why he didn't give the penalty and he said the assistant behind the goal said it hit him in the face. I don't know what angle he is looking from because everyone else could see it was a penalty. 'He said the referee behind the goal said it hit him in the face and there is nothing I can do about that now. It is a game-changing decision. 'When you have officials behind the goals, they need to be doing their job. If he thinks that's him in on the face ...? 'I don't really want to say too much about the officials because I'll end up in trouble. But it's a massive, massive decision and it's cost us the game. 'Everybody was so content that we were going to win the league, we already have a trophy (the League Cup) in the bag. Everyone was saying the Scottish Cup was practically a given. But we knew we had to come here and do a job - and it's just unlucky that we never managed to get it done.' Griffiths attempts an acrobatic shot at goal during the Scottish Cup semi-final on Sunday against Inverness . As much as Griffiths was nursing a personal grievance over being denied yet another Hampden semi-final goal, the former Hibs star felt for manager Deila, a man who has been so open about his desire to win a Treble – and his belief in this team's ability to do so. Celtic had made no bones about their determination to succeed where so many had failed, backing themselves to have the skill and strength to get the job done, whatever obstacles they might have to overcome. 'I think the gaffer is the most disappointed person out of everyone,' said the Griffiths. 'He'd only have been the third Celtic manager to have won a Treble. 'He would have made history and as players we would have become legends. But it' s difficult to do that. I said it during the week that when you are that close to winning a Treble, the games get harder. Inverness stood in our way and did a job. 'Now we have to go again and pick ourselves up for the rest of the season. We have a massive game at Dens Park on Wednesday. Dundee will be up for it, we've just played 120 minutes in a semi-final. We have three days and then we have to play Dundee at a difficult venue. But we need three points. 'This will fire us up. We aren't far away from clinching the league now. We have two hard games in the next week at Dens and Tannadice. If we go there and pick up three points from each, we will be in a real good position.' From Treble to Double, just like that. Celtic will be weary on Wednesday, certainly. But Dundee should certainly beware some kind of angry backlash. And the Dens Park ground staff may want to reinforce some of the doors. Just in case Brown takes the storm with him.

Perry Clawson, a former Army colonel, was pictured Friday sitting outside the University of Florida's Zeta Beta Tau frat house in Gainesville, waving a Stars and Stripes of his own. Clawson, who said the members had 'p*****d off' servicemen across the country with their actions, pitched up outside the building, proudly displayed the flag which accompanied him on two tours of duty to Iraq. Shall not be moved: Perry Clawson, a retired Army colonel, pitched up outside the Zeta Beta Tau frat house in protest of their alleged treatment of wounded veterans . Disrespected: Nicholas Connole, pictured, said that braying students spat on him and his service dog as he tried to enjoy a vacation with his wife . Service: Connole is picutred above during on of his tours of duty in the Middle East . 'Disgusting': Linda Cope, who founded the retreat to honor her wounded son, said she saw frat members urinating on the U.S. flag . He was one of many veterans to respond to unedifying allegations that Zeta Beta Tau members had abused soldiers attending the Warrior Beach vacation retreat in Panama City Beach, the Gainesville Sun reported. The charity event provides vacations for maimed soldiers, their carers and families - but ran afoul of braying frat boys holding an event of their own earlier this month. One veteran, wounded Nicholas Connole, said frat members spat on him and his service dog from their balconies. He told local TV station WJHG: 'They actually spat on me and my service dog as well, and that's just so disrespectful and it hurts.' Haley Riley, whose husband is another injured veteran, said students hurled beer bottles at attendees. Linda Cope, who founded the retreat after her son lost both his legs in an IED explosion, said that rowdy students even went so far as to urinated on the American flag. Suspension: The Zeta Beta Tau chapter at the University of FLorida has been suspended, and three of its members expelled. There is nothing to suggest anybody in the photograph above was involved . Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was suspended in the wake of the allegations, which university authorities are investigating. They have charged the organization with 'causing physical or other harm, obscene behavior, public intoxication, theft and property damage'. The fraternity has expelled three members and is also holding its own investigation. The expelled frat members have not been named. It has yet to determine what exactly took place, but said in a statement that 'there is no doubt that some our members engaged in unacceptable behavior.' While Panama City Beach police were called to deal with the frat members, they ultimately let the resort management handle them, and did not file any charges or write a police report. Zeta Beta Tau's University of Florida chapter was already on probation after being found guilty of holding hazing rituals at the start of this academic year. It was already restricted to a limited events program - and will face even tougher penalties than usual if the university decides to take action. Another Zeta Beta Tau chapter, belonging to Emory University in Georgia, was also caught up in the allegations, but has denied that any of its students were involved.","Retired Col.

Robert Gentile appeared in federal court in Hartford, . Connecticut, on Friday and was charged with selling a firearm to . an undercover agent. His attorney, Ryan McGuigan, contended Federal Bureau of . Investigation agents really want to see what Gentile knows about the . theft of $500million in artwork from Boston's Isabel Stewart . Gardner Museum 25 years ago. Scroll down for video . Robert Gentile's attorney Ryan McGuigan (pictured), said that though his client was arrested on a gun charge, he believes the arrest was a ruse to pressure Gentile to speak about the $500million art heist from 1990 . A security guard at Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner museum stands outside the room from which most of the paintings were pilfered the day after the massive heist . This FBI sketch shows a likeness of the two suspects, who were reportedly wearing police uniforms when they performed the theft. They have have never been caught . 'The FBI has been questioning him for years because they . think he knows the whereabouts of the Gardner paintings,' McGuigan said. He added: 'But he's being set up, just like others who are . threatened with long periods of incarceration by the FBI in the . Gardner case. 'The gun charge is just an excuse to question and . threaten him further.' Police previously identified three suspects in the theft: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. Merlino and Guarente have died. Gentile has denied any knowledge of the heist and the missing work. The thieves stole two Rembrandts - The Storm on the Sea of Galilee (left), believed to be the only seascape the master painted, and A Lady and Gentleman in Black. Jan Vermeer's The Concert (right) was also stolen and is one of approximately 35 known works by the great Dutch painter . Chez Tortoni, painted by Manet, shows a man wearing a top hat at a jaunty angle; it was one of the last paintings to be stolen from the museum . Govaert Flinck's 'Landscape with an Obelisk,' painted in 1638, was originally attributed to Rembrandt, but was later found to be the work of his assistant, Flinck . The FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office in Connecticut declined . to comment on McGuigan's claim. The Gardner heist took place on the rainy night of March 18, . 1990, when two men posing as police officers arrived at the . museum's front door. The guards on duty let them in and the pair . allegedly overpowered them, one of whom spoke earlier this year about his guilt of letting the men in. The next morning the guards were found duct-taped to chairs . in the basement and 13 artworks including Rembrandt van Rijn's 'Storm on . the Sea of Galilee' and Johannes Vermeer's 'The Concert' were missing. A Degas sketch from 1884 (left) and a self-portrait of Rembrandt (right) were also among the items stolen from the museum . The empty frames from Rembrandt's 'Storm on the Sea of Galilee' and Vermeer's 'The Concert' remain on display in the museum as a constant physical reminder of the heist and the missing masterpieces . Left, a visitor looks at the empty frame from a Rembrandt work, and right, the museum pictured in 1990 following the heist, the empty frame of Rembrandt's oil painting 'A Lady and Gentleman in Black' lies on the floor and a space on the wall remains bare where his 'The Storm on the Sea of Galilee' once hung . In total the haul including three Rembrandt works, five sketches by Edgar Degas, an Édouard Manet painting and a painting by Vermeer - one of only 36 in the world. A bronze eagle statue, a Chinese beaker from 1100 BC and a painting by Govaert Flinck were also taken. Due to a quirk in the museum founder's will, the empty frames that once held those paintings remain on the walls, an ever-present reminder of one of Boston longest-unsolved crimes. Aside from two sketches of mustachioed men in police hats - one with glasses and one without - little detail has ever been given as to who the thieves may have been. The FBI identified three persons of interest in the Gardner case, all with ties to organized crime: Carmello Merlino, Robert Guarente, and Robert Gentile. In 2012 Robert Gentile's Connecticut home and shed (pictured) was searched by the FBI in connection with the case . gents used radar, as well as two beagles and a ferret, to dig up parts of Gentile's front lawn in 2012; the FBI warrant allowed the use of ground-penetrating radar . FBI investigators have long said they believed organized . crime groups were behind the heist. Gentile in 2012 submitted to a lie detector test that showed . a high likelihood that he had lied when he investigators asked . if he had any knowledge of the heist, according to court . testimony. A 2012 FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the . stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as police . uniforms. Gentile has a criminal record dating back to the 1950s. Most . recently he spent two years in prison after being convicted of . illegally selling prescription drugs to an informant. The gun charge he currently faces could carry a ten-year prison charge if he is convicted due to his status as a felon. The FBI search of Gentile's home turned up a list of the stolen art pieces and their estimated value, as well as policeuniforms .

93a56eb66611037c19d47c2cfb759c38d7abf95a,"(CNN)It came a day early. Baltimore investigators handed their files on Freddie Gray's death over to prosecutors Thursday, but the public shouldn't expect much. It's largely a procedural step, and given the overtures from Baltimore officials, the state's attorney's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate. No reports will be made public, police Commissioner Anthony Batts said, echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files, the task force assigned to Gray's death will continue investigating. ""That is just us sitting down, providing all the data we have. We will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes,"" Batts said. The Gray family's legal team had no expectations otherwise. ""I hate to say this, but I think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come,"" attorney Mary Koch said this week, ""I don't think that's going to happen based on the way the process works, and I think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what's going to happen."" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake seemed reluctant to do so during a Thursday interview with CNN. Pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming, the mayor seemed to dance around the question. Handing over the report represents ""an inflection point,"" she said at first, before explaining that it also marks a ""continuation in a process toward justice."" She went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times, that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution. Asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately, she said Baltimore officials had a ""duty to protect the justice process."" Prodded on whether the public should expect her or Batts to announce findings, she said she didn't want to ""seek justice for optics"" and explained she had spoken to schools, clergy and community leaders about what to expect. Finally, asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over, she replied: ""Well, it can't be the end. There's been no charges. There's been no trial. It cannot be the end."" The family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient, Koch said Thursday. ""We've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete, ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged, those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks,"" she said. Perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on Baltimore is that there is not one, but two investigations, seeking to determine how Gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody. The mayhem since Gray's April 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting, vandalism, blazes, attacks on police and firefighters, marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken, or at least outweighed, updates about the investigations. Newly appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the FBI ""will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks."" Because of the Baltimore police's history, the Justice Department has been working with the force since October as part of a reform initiative that will assess ""policies, training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens."" Rawlings-Blake requested that the Justice Department take a look at the police department, The Baltimore Sun reported, saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper's report that the city had paid almost $6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011. Overwhelmingly, The Sun reported, the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges. Asked during her Thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in Gray's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- Rawlings-Blake, an attorney by trade, said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the Baltimore Police Department and repair the community's mistrust in police. ""Quite likely, but it could be the same situation, and at the end of the day, it's about this case and making sure we're getting this case right. It has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there. This family wants justice. They don't want us to sit here and speculate about what could've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it,"" she said. Rawlings-Blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability. ""We welcome outside review,"" police spokesman Capt. Eric Kowalczyk has said. ""We want to be open. We want to be transparent. We owe it to the city, and we owe it to the Gray family to find out exactly what happened."" According to police, officers encountered Gray on April 12 and he ""fled unprovoked."" Three officers gave chase, apprehended Gray and carried him -- screaming, his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van. Once at the police station, officers requested an ambulance, which took Gray to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center, where he died a week later. An autopsy report indicated Gray died of a spinal injury, but Batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert's analysis before issuing his final report. So far, six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay: Sgt. Alicia White, 30; Officer William Porter, 25; Officer Garrett Miller, 26; Officer Edward Nero, 29; Lt. Brian Rice, 41; and Officer Caesar Goodson, 45. Five of them have given statements to investigators, Batts said. Releasing the officers' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing, Kowalczyk said. Though the investigation is not yet complete, Batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in Gray's arrest did not follow protocol. ""We know he was not buckled in the transport wagon, as he should've been. No excuses for that, period,"" he said. ""We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times."" That Gray wasn't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what's known as a ""rough ride"" or ""nickel ride,"" in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around. Asked if Gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van, Batts said there is ""potential"" that both could be true. Baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into Gray's death, Batts said. They've conducted dozens of interviews, canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras. Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis, who is overseeing the task force as the head of the Investigations and Intelligence Bureau, said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying Gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station. But on Thursday, he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop. Rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see Gray, Davis said last week. Two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot, pursuing Gray for about one-fifth of a mile, he said. ""That's where the apprehension of Freddie Gray occurred, and quite frankly, that's exactly where Freddie Gray should have received medical attention, and he did not,"" Davis said last week. The paddy wagon carrying Gray traveled about one block before stopping, and Gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons, Davis said last week. On Thursday, Davis revealed that the van stopped again, about a mile from where police placed shackles on Gray. He did not elaborate on that stop. From there, according to the narrative Davis provided last week, the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again ""to deal with Mr. Gray, and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,"" he said. It was at that stop, Batts added, that officers lifted Gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van. Gray requested a medic during that stop, he said. The van then traveled to another incident, about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where Gray was first spotted and chased. There, a second prisoner was placed in the van, which headed back to the police department's Western District building, about a mile away, the deputy commissioner said. It was only then that an ambulance was called and Gray was taken to the hospital. ""It's complex,"" Davis said of the probe. ""It involves a minutiae of details. It requires our full talents, our full time, and we're going to get this right."" CNN's Chris Cuomo contributed to this report.","Prosecutors get investigative report a day early, but don't expect immediate word on charges .

475ed771e0c8382c1ce3025f1eb21afd484c3a72,"(CNN)Thousands of Syrian and Palestinian refugees trapped in the Yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities. But while the story is in itself tragic, it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling. I encountered two such individuals on my mission to Damascus -- Jihad and Mohammad -- tiny, vulnerable infants who were taken from Yarmouk in recent days, a place that was described last week by the U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as ""the deepest circle of hell."" The fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children. Looking into those bright young faces, touching their pristine hands, the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me. Like the wider Syrian conflict, Yarmouk has a human face; the faces of young Mohammad and young Jihad. I want to introduce you to them in the hope that you, too, will understand why I am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in Syria. Jihad Ya'qoub, the youngest Palestinian refugee to flee Yarmouk, was born on March 30. His mother, Said Fatima, never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough. ""I was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy, but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items,"" she said. Said Fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day. Mohammad was born in Yarmouk on January 25 of this year. When ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- entered the camp and tensions heightened, his mother, Nadia, fled in search of safety. Her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son. Yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future. She hopes that if and when life returns to normal, she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in Yarmouk. These tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all. When I next brief the Security Council, as I did a few days ago, I will tell them about Jihad and Mohammad.  I will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside Yarmouk, other civilians who need help where they are. To do this, hostilities will have to subside. Pressure must be exerted on armed actors in Yarmouk to this end. Beyond that, those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely. These things are all possible. But it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more, nothing less. Yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold. I believe they can. Because to abandon such belief would be to abandon Jihad, Mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them. And that is simply not an option.","Yarmouk is a refugee camp near Damascus in war-ravaged Syria .

8e2df8305bde3aab6be00deac30cfb1b59e6d383,"(CNN)Geography is, in part, destiny for Italy: The country will always be a bridge between Africa and Europe, as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean so starkly shows. A surge of refugees this year, usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels, has sought to reach Europe via the Libyan coast.  A boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from Libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking. Over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of Italy in the last week alone. European leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency. There is a backstory here worthy of our attention, and it has to do with Italy's colonial past. Many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of Italy's former colonies in North and East Africa, namely Eritrea (occupied from 1890-1941) and Somalia (1908-1941). As migrants, Libyans are fewer in number, but Libya (1912-1941) plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for Italy. Italy's empire never rivaled that of the British and the French in scope and longevity, but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected. Indeed, the migrants traversing the Mediterranean today form part of a century-long chain of migrations, expulsions, and exiles sparked by Italy's imperial ambition and commercial interests, the post-colonial anger of African leaders, and now mass economic desperation and political strife. Long after the formal end of Italian colonialism, these Eritreans, Somalis, and Libyans have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries. It also affects the treatment of Africans who settle in Italy. Libya is an example of the long reach of Italian imperialism. Libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of Italy, on the model of French Algeria, and Libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship's persecution of those who resisted Italian occupation. Over 100,000 Libyan men, women, and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed. Col. Moammar Gadhafi, who ruled from 1969 to 2011, was born during the Italian occupation of his country, and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as Omar al-Mukhtar, who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931. In 1970, soon after he took power, Gadhafi struck back, expelling the remaining Italian community in Libya. Some of those people had grown up entirely in Libya. They arrived in Italy for the first time, at some of the same ports receiving migrants today. This political intervention did not spell the end of Italian-Libyan commercial dealings, which grew out of colonial-era relations that had made Libya Italy's biggest oil supplier. Since 2004, Italy and Libya have been directly connected by the Greenstream natural gas pipeline, which runs below the Mediterranean, on the same axis as many migrant boats. Commercial concerns, and the cozy relationship of then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi, also lay behind a historic 2008 Friendship Treaty between Italy and Libya, which promised infrastructure and other aid to Libya worth the equivalent of $5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by Italy during the decades of colonial rule. Until his death in 2011, despite deals with Italy and the European Union to control departures from his borders, Gadhafi intermittently used European fears of mass arrivals of migrants from Libya as a political weapon. Given Europe's geography, this weapon was pointed particularly at Italy, Libya's former master, and the principal target of Gadhafi's post-colonial revenge politics. Few Italians learn about this colonial history and its legacies, even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former Italian colonies and elsewhere are on the rise. Upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration, Cécile Kyenge, an Italian of Congolese origin, faced ugly racist attacks from fellow Italian politicians, including a comment that she looked like an orangutan. This climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the ""heroes"" of fascist imperialism. In 2012, the town of Affile built a publicly-funded memorial to General Rodolfo Graziani, known as ""the butcher of Fezzan"" for his brutal repression of Libyan resisters in the 1920s -- and for the massacre of Ethiopian civilians he ordered in response to a 1937 attempt on his life. This colonial history and its long-term consequences can help us understand Italians' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores. Italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly, and yet migrants who remain in Italy are often subject to racist attacks. It is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the Italian Navy in 2013 was the slogan of the fascist's dictatorship's bid to control the Mediterranean: Mare Nostrum. The program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to European Union budget restrictions. It seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the Italian government to its past aggressions: an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner. The Italian government deserves the full support of the European Union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis. But it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past. At 40 years old, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the Mediterranean. Setting a new course on this issue is in Italy's interest, now more than ever.","Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Italy's colonial past plays a key role in the migrant humanitarian disaster in the Mediterranean .

82d9d60e0360159b6767e0921de88360a93da0f5,"Yaya Toure's attacking gifts aren't enough to make up for his defensive deficiencies anymore, said Gary Neville in a scathing attack on the Ivorian following Manchester City's 4-2 derby loss to United. Manuel Pellegrini's City were poor for all but the opening 15 minutes against Louis van Gaal's side at Old Trafford and Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, is certain big changes are afoot for the club. 'It's a crossroads for them now,' Neville said as City drifted four points behind their third-placed cross-city rivals who are now one point off Arsenal in second. Yaya Toure's defensive lapses are costing Manchester City, claims Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville . Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness joined the chorus of criticism of the under-fire Ivorian . 'There is definitely going to be change at Manchester City, whether it's players, the manager, people above. Certainly some players. 'There are some weeds in the garden and you've got to get them out of the changing room pretty quick. You cannot carry passengers.' Neville singled out Toure as an example of the 'weeds' at the Etihad in a scathing attack. 'He does that much for the team in an attacking sense you live with maybe the consequences of that defensively,' he said. 'But when the balance tips to a point when going forward isn't quite as effective as it once was, you've got to do something different because the defensive side is poor. Neville predicts changes at Manchester City and says the club need to get rid of 'weeds in the garden' 'If I was a player in that dressing room looking at him in central midfield thinking you're not chasing back, you're not running around, you're not sprinting for the ball. There might be a physical problem that he cannot do it, let alone if he doesn't want to do it. I think there's definitely going to be some changes.' Graeme Souness, also on Sky Sports, even suggested the 31-year-old's work when his side doesn't have the ball is a factor in their disappointing Champions League results in recent years. Neville accused Toure of a 'complete dereliction of (his) duty' when marking Marouane Fellaini and blamed his lack of tracking back for United's third goal from Juan Mata. City players' heads drop after conceding the fourth goal on Sunday their their cross-city rivals . 'He cannot play in a two in midfield against an opposition of any quality,' said Neville on Sky Sports. 'Against maybe one of the lesser teams at home you can put him in there and play with two up top, but against any team of quality you've got to shift him out of that position in the centre of midfield. 'There are too many examples, too much evidence when watching him where he cannot do his job, simple as that. As a central midfield player in the big matches he just cannot do it.' Souness said Toure's become 'a bit of a liability' for City in the past two years, despite being instrumental to their Premier League title win last season. Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young celebrate after the winger's cross found the tall Belgian for 2-1 . 'When he is playing and he has the ball at his feet, he is a real threat going forward,' the former Liverpool midfielder said. 'When they don't have the ball he doesn't want to take part and come back towards his own goal.' 'He just doesn't take part when City have the ball, they're too easy to play against. And that's a problem they've had for the last couple of seasons. And maybe that's one of the big reasons why they've not done as well as they should have done in Europe.' Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher pointed the finger at the City chiefs for allowing the team to get into their current state and said the fallen champions are 'gone'. The former Liverpool defender told talkSPORT: 'They’ve been a great team, but that team needs breaking up and changing. The criticism I have is for the people at the top, to have that much money and to allow yourself to get into a situation where you might need five or six players to go straight into the team. 'You look at the age of the team and it’s too old, so you need a lot of new blood. It’s going to take a lot of money. 'It’s gone for them now, physically, mentally, every part of the game. They’ve been a great team and we should applaud what they’ve achieved over the past three or four years, but it’s the end for this team now. It’s got to be broken up.' Niall Quinn, also on Sky Sports, said bluntly: 'Manchester City lost out today because he was all at sea and didn't do his defensive duties.' Toure also came in for criticism on Match of the Day 2 for his lack of leadership after he took the captain's armband at half-time. Trevor Sinclair said: 'He keeps on getting caught in no-mans land, he's not really at it, clipping the heels, and he's literally going through the motions. Trevor Sinclair and Phil Neville were both critical of City and Toure on Match of the Day 2 . 'Fellaini has completely outshone him today. He is outnumbered and I'm sure he's frustrated but again he's just going through the motions.' Picking out on particular aerial duel, which Toure lost, Sinclair said: 'This is nothing to do with ability, that's to do with desire and wanting to take one for the team.' Sinclair also felt Toure was at fault for Chris Smalling's goal, United's fourth. 'He's got to organise this better,' he said. 'If you're captain of the team you've got to keep that high line, dictate and tell the lads to get in positions and win the ball. They were queuing up on the far stick.' Phil Neville said: 'The minute they concede a goal and their backs are against the wall, they crumble. They lost their shape, they lost their discipline, they were all over the place. 'There was nobody in there today that said ""right, we're going to get two banks of four, hard to beat and actually try to grind out a result"".'","Manchester City lost 4-2 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday .

7c6c23308ccf66884d47fa996e081ca8e2202f23,"Australia’s very own nocturnal, rabbit-eared Easter mascot is under threat with bilby numbers becoming dangerously low. The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area with small populations remaining in Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Kevin Bradley, CEO of Save the Bilby Fund told Daily Mail Australia that it’s very difficult to pin point the exact number of bilbies left in Australia because of their ‘cryptic’ nocturnal habits. Scroll down for video . The native Australian marsupial once occupied more than 70 per cent of the Australian mainland while now it’s disappeared from around 80 per cent of that area . ‘We know they are extinct in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia with very few bilbies left in Queensland and scattered populations in the Northern Territory and Western Australia’ 'Things aren’t looking great and their future in the wild is very tenuous.’ In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Mr Bradley said the critters were of 'high significance to traditional land owners' with record of bilby populations dating back '15 million years'. Until recently, Australia had two species of Bilbies- the Greater Bilby and the Lesser Bilby. The Lesser Bilby is already believed to be extinct while the Greater Bilby is classed as ‘endangered’ in Queensland and ‘vulnerable’ nationally. In recent years the bilby has become an important part of the Australian Easter tradition however, its ties with our Indigenous community dates back much further with bilbies making their way into dream time stories. Predators like feral cats and foxes are the biggest threat to the bilby populations while other contributing factors include farm animals destroying bilby habitat and introduced species like rabbits competing with them for food and burrows. Mr Bradley said foxes and feral cats are ‘desimating the population.’ The Australian Wildlife Conservancy said feral cats are the driving force behind the dramatic decline of wildlife across the country with the feral felines killing an estimated 75 million native animals every night. 'I think people are starting to recognise that these animals are having such a devastating effect on many native animal populations.' Mr Bradley said the Federal Government has committed to a National Feral Animal Summit this year that will  focus on creating a plan to address the feral cat issue. In the mean time, the Save the Bilby Fund have developed a captive breeding program and believe that continuing breeding efforts in controlled environments could be they key to saving the endangered marsupial. The Greater Bilby is a nocturnal marsupial with a silky grey and white coat and a long black and white tail. Bilbies have large ears, a long snouts and a great sense of smell that helps them locate food. The bilby is omnivorous and eats bulbs, fruit, seeds, fungi, insects, worms, termintes and even small lizards or spiders. They don’t need regular water because, like koalas, they get most of their water from their food. The Royal Visit: Even the Royal family, pictured, wanted to drop by to get some face time with the native marsupial .","Bilby numbers are dropping with only around 600 left in Queensland .

c0ff7635ebabf8000197cdbd68f76e4a0b463be8,"(CNN)A longtime friend of Joni Mitchell has filed a legal petition seeking to be named the singer-songwriter's conservator. Mitchell, who was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997, was taken to UCLA Medical Center a month ago after being found unconscious in her home. She remains at the hospital, according to Leslie Morris' court petition filed April 28. Morris is described as Mitchell's friend of more than 44 years in the legal documents. Whether the folk and jazz singer is conscious remains a matter of some confusion. In her April 28 petition, Morris says Mitchell is unconscious: ""At this time she (Mitchell) remains unconscious and unable to make any responses, and is therefore unable to provide for any of her personal needs."" But on Mitchell's website, a statement posted the same day that says it was approved by Morris says Mitchell is alert. ""Contrary to rumors circulating on the Internet today, Joni is not in a coma. Joni is still in the hospital -- but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority -- in the absence of 24-hour doctor care -- to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital."" When asked about the discrepancy between statements about Mitchell's health on her website and in the legal filing, her publicist, Alisse Kingsley, responded that ""the website"" was accurate. A doctor's capacity declaration stated that Mitchell will likely be unable, due to her medical condition, to attend any court hearings for the next four to six months.

With Jonathan Trott out without scoring in the first over and captain Alastair Cook failing again Vaughan said: ‘Their footwork and their mindset has been about looking to survive rather than getting on top.’ Geoff Boycott was also critical of the pair, saying: ‘Opening batsmen are supposed to face the new ball when it’s doing a little bit.

69af3b9fc4ba1fa6bd272c82d17ec318da5ff97a,"(CNN)When I was elected to the Kentucky State Senate in 1967, I became the first woman and the first person of color to serve in the body.  Five decades later, I find it almost unfathomable that a politician from my own state is attempting to launch his presidential campaign on a record that includes questioning landmark voting rights and civil rights legislation. But that is what Rand Paul, who today declared he's running for president of the United States, is doing. His campaign team told reporters last week that his campaign announcement message would be about ""expanding the Republican Party"" -- a message of inclusion. But those of us listening today who he is hoping to include, heard nothing more than hype. I'm not buying it. Since coming to the U.S. Senate, Paul has tried to sell himself as a different type of Republican.  He's tried to brand himself as the GOP's minority outreach candidate.  The problem for Paul, and the GOP at large, is that they don't back up their words with their policies. Yes, it's about time that Republicans started seriously considering the fact that black voters are an important piece of the electoral puzzle.  But they can't actually appeal to the community unless they have a real commitment to the issues facing minority communities.  A quick survey of Sen. Paul's positions makes clear that he does not. Paul kicked off his announcement speech in Louisville by declaring ""I have a message that is loud and clear:  We have come to take our country back.""  I have no doubt that under Paul's leadership, he would indeed take our country back -- in the wrong direction -- way back to a time when we were debating the Civil Rights Act --  which Paul has done since landing on the national stage; when there was no Department of Education -- a department he thinks ""should be done away with;"" when women didn't have choices -- choices Paul seeks to limit in Washington; when DREAMers weren't protected from deportation -- protections Paul currently opposes. In his inept speaking engagements at historically black colleges and universities, he has come across as condescending and lacking basic cultural competency. But Paul has also questioned the Civil Rights Act, and even claimed that private business owners have a right to discriminate. When asked about the need for a more robust Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's dismantling of the law, Paul dismissively remarked, ""We have an African-American President."" When President Obama stood with John Lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the Edmund Pettus Bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, he inspired us all by saying: ""With effort, we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity. ... With effort, we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote."" America is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy, not less.  Unfortunately Rand Paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle.  Paul tried once again from that stage in Louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden Republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year. But his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated, outside of the mainstream, and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country. The American people deserve a leader who won't disrespect their intelligence, who won't pander to them when it's convenient, and who won't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades. What I heard today, didn't change the facts about Rand Paul's record.  The American people deserve better than Rand Paul.","Georgia Powers: Rand Paul, running for president, would like minorities to think he's an advocate. His record on rights shows otherwise .

f0bd9de49bd9e4ae617e8ceccdd2726afe542ce3,"The stylist behind singer Rita Ora's unique, over-the-top hairstyles has revealed how much work the chart-topper has to put into ensuring her blonde locks remain totally healthy. Chris Appleton, who has been working with natural brunette Rita, 24, for the past two years, confessed to Daily Mail Online that her demanding haircare routine does require a hefty amount of work and 'maintenance'. 'We have to color the hair every three weeks,' he explained. 'We've managed to get the timing perfect so that she's not coloring it all the time. If you keep bleaching it, you push it too far and it can look awful, which has been done in the past by other celebrities! Scroll down for video . Style icon: Chris Appleton (R) has been working as singer Rita Ora's hairstylist for two years . Haircare regimen: According to Chris, Rita's blonde locks need to be colored every three weeks, a process which can dry out the hair if done too frequently . 'I also make my own hair masks, which I make her sleep in, to ensure that her hair stays in the best condition possible. 'I'm so strict with Rita, I want to make sure that her hair always looks great, and that means a lot of work. When she has any spare time, I make her condition.' But despite the seemingly endless hours of maintenance required in order to keep Rita's barnet looking its best, Chris insists that the singer isn't planning to follow in Kim Kardashian's footsteps and make a change to brunette any time soon. 'Blonde is such a statement, despite the fact that it's a lot of maintenance behind the scenes,' he said. 'We've never done anything deep or dark and we change the actual style so much that I'm eager to keep the color consistent.' The singer did have a chance to experiment with a darker hairstyle when she appeared in the recently-released Fifty Shades of Grey movie however; Rita's role as Mia, the younger sister of charismatic businessman Christian Grey, saw her don an extremely short, dark wig, which Chris believes helped Rita to separate herself from the character. Innovation: Every hairstyle that Rita models has something unique and different about it. 'I always want to do something to make her hair look special,' Chris explains . The girl with the pearl... hair: This embellished hairstyle is one of Chris' favorites . 'It worked for the film, because she wasn't Rita, she was Mia Grey, and I think that was a good thing,' Chris said. 'But I don't know if it's a style we will be trying out on Rita in real life!' While Rita might not be planning to replicate Mia's severe hairstyle any time soon however, Chris says that she is certainly not averse to experimenting with a variety of different looks - be they temporary, or permanent. Indeed, the decision to cut Rita's hair into a much shorter style just a few months ago was actually made on a whim, during a late-night styling session. 'I was talking to Rita about chopping her hair for a year, but it was about finding the right time,' he explained. 'Then at two in the morning, I was working on her hair, and we'd been doing it for hours, and she just said: ""I think it's time."" 'She called me the next day and was so happy with it, which was great. And it looks amazing, it was just a bit weird that we decided to do it then and there so late at night, or early in the morning I guess.' CopyKaty: According to Chris, singer Katy Perry recreated two of Rita's hairstyles for her This is How We Do video . Something different: For her role as Mia Grey in the recently-released movie Fifty Shades of Grey, Rita had the chance to experiment with darker locks . And beyond the length and color of Rita's hair, Chris is determined to ensure that her style is always fresh, unique and interesting, and is often experimenting with different textures, embellishments and colorful accessories. 'Sometimes I get a lot of time to work on a look - I'll know what outfit she's planning to wear for a red carpet, or an appearance, and I can plan accordingly,' he explained. 'Other times, I don't really get any time at all and I just have to pull it out of the bag! 'But I always want to do something to make her hair look special; if she's wearing a really detailed dress and we want the hair to be more simple, I'll do something really subtle - like the gold leaf that we used in her parting at the 2014 Met Gala. 'But if we want to go all out, then we'll work with loads of different accessories, or colors. I loved when we sewed loads of pearls into her hair, I thought that looked amazing. And it was so different and unique.' 'It's all about the details - I’m all about adding details to the hair. People will watch, [so] make it worthwhile.' Put a ring on it: Chris and Rita will often work together in order to come up with a new and unique way of accessorizing her hairstyle . Twisted: Rita often showcases Chris' work on her Instagram account . While Chris admits that he and Rita don't always see eye-to-eye about what hairstyle they should go for, he adds that she is always willing to go the extra mile in order to create something that is totally unique. And it seems that the seemingly endless hours Rita and Chris have spent working on maintaining and perfecting her varied hairstyles have more than paid off, with many of the more elaborate styles inspiring numerous other celebrities and style icons to create similar looks. 'The people behind the new Star Wars movie loved the hair we created for the UK version of The Voice [on which Rita is a judge] so much that they are going to use it in their next film,' Chris revealed. 'Katy Perry also did a similar style to the gelled baby hair that Rita had at Coachella for her This is How We Do video. 'The same look was also used at a number of fashion shows including DKNY and Givenchy.' 'Chris is incredibly talented,' Rita says of her ongoing relationship with the hairstylist. 'We work so well together drawing inspiration from any number of things - from Marilyn Monroe to London street fashion. Chris is always up for creating real moments, trying something different while keeping me smiling the whole way.'","Hairstylist Chris Appleton explained the inspiration for 24-year-old Rita's unique and over-the-top hairstyles .

New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady also threw a first pitch, at Fenway Park in Boston - but didn't do himself proud, chucking the ball straight at the ground.

Taya Kyle gets a hug from San Diego Padres starting pitcher Andrew Cashner after throwing out the first ceremonial pitch . De Blasio's relations with the police unions and some rank-and-file officers were fractured in the aftermath of the December shooting that claimed the lives of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. They were murdered on patrol in Brooklyn on December 20 by a crazed gunman who then committed suicide. Since that crisis, which threatened to overwhelm the mayor's agenda, de Blasio has taken pains to repair relations with the nation's largest police force, brokering a new union contract, investing in new technology and training, and doubling down on his public praise of the department. On Monday, he joined the tens of thousands of fans in cheering as the officers' images were displayed on the park's giant video screens and again when Ramos' two sons and Liu's widow threw out the pitches to Mets players David Wright, Matt Harvey and Curtis Granderson. De Blasio, however, was largely booed when he was introduced to the crowd. A year ago, de Blasio was also booed as he threw out the first pitch (a strike). Both years, he sported a Mets cap and jersey, which was emblazoned with his last name and the number 6, a tribute to Rico Petrocelli, a longtime shortstop on de Blasio's favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. Petrocelli, like de Blasio, was also of Italian descent and lived in Brooklyn. The tribute to the NYPD comes as de Blasio is weighing a City Council proposal to hire 1,000 more police officers. The idea has been endorsed by union leaders who said it would reduce pressure on existing officers to keep crime low. But de Blasio rejected an identical council proposal a year ago, pointing to the city's record low crime and suggesting that the money would be better spent elsewhere.

Members of the Liu and Ramos families, including Yenjian Liu's widow, Pei Xia Chen, second from left, throw out the ceremonial first pitch . Police Commissioner William Bratton has, at times, signaled support for the effort to hire more officers for the department, which now has a headcount of about 34,500, about 6,000 fewer than at its peak in 2001. De Blasio has not committed to hiring more officers but has been more receptive to the proposal in his public remarks than he was a year ago. The council's budget office projected that hiring two new classes of officers, to total 1,000, would cost nearly $69m in the upcoming fiscal year. But the council believes that the cost will be offset by the corresponding reduction in overtime.

The home side laid siege to the Thistle defence at the start of the match but had to rely on a Kris Commons penalty a minute before the break to give them the interval lead. Thistle midfielder James Craigen had been shown a straight red card by referee Willie Collum for a 'last man' foul on Hoops midfielder Stuart Armstrong to concede the spot-kick. leaving the visitors a player down for the second half. Stuart Armstrong is brought down by Partick Thistle's James Craigen leading to a penalty . Referee Willie Collum shows Craigen a read card for his 'last man' challenge on Armstrong . Celtic striker Kris Commons steps up to convert the penalty to give his side a 1-0 lead before the break . Commons (right) races away to celebrates his 45th minute penalty strike . Midfielder Stefan Johansen, stand-in skipper in the absence of suspended Scott Brown, added a second in the 63rd minute as the encounter turned into a Hoops procession. With second-placed Aberdeen beating Inverness 1-0, Ronny Deila's side maintained the gap over the Dons but also have a game in hand as the title race draws closer to conclusion. With a heavy schedule in mind, the Hoops boss returned midfielder Nir Bitton, Gary Mackay-Steven and striker John Guidetti his starting line-up. Thistle manager Alan Archibald was forced into one change with forward Kallum Higginbotham coming in for the injured Kris Doolan but he was mostly a spectator as the Firhill defence was forced to withstand an early Hoops' barrage. Celtic came close twice before two minutes had elapsed. Stefan Johansen doubles Celtic's advantage in the 63rd minute with left-footed shot into the bottom corner . Johansen is mobbed by his team-mates following his second-half strike . Parkhead defender Virgil van Dijk, up for a corner, flicked an Armstrong cross against the crossbar at the near post before a desperate blocking tackle by Maryhill defender Conrad Balatoni prevented an almost certain goal from Johansen's drive. Balatoni again came to Thistle rescue in the ninth minute, beating Guidetti to a header in front of an empty goal, after left-back Emilio Izaguirre had troubled Fox after surging into the penalty area. Moments later, Mackay-Steven was set up Johansen but his goalbound drive from 12 yards was deflected away by Thistle defender Callum Booth. Yet, in the 21st minute, in a rare attack, the visitors almost snatched the lead but Higginbotham's spectacular volley from 14 yards was saved by Craig Gordon - but only on the stretch. Commons' long-distance drive in the 28th minute just cleared the bar but a minute before the break he was more accurate from the spot, firing the penalty low into the corner giving the despairing Fox no chance. Leigh Griffiths spurns a glorious opportunity to put Celtic 3-0 ahead late in the match . The goal came as some relief to the home fans who had grown slightly irritated as the first half wore on. Two minutes after the break Commons forced Fox into a decent save with a powerful 25-yard drive and while the Maryhill defence cleared their lines from rebound it looked ominous. Thistle continued to defend stoutly and desperately in equal measures but were undone again when Johansen took a clever Guidetti pass before rolling the ball into the corner of the net from 10 yards. Two minutes after replacing Guidetti, Leigh Griffiths somehow turned a Mackay-Steven cross past the far post from two yards out but it was inconsequential. In the 79th minute, with the game drifting, Gordon made another good save, this time from Thistle substitute Gary Fraser, on for Stuart Bannigan. Johansen came close at the other end with a chip which Fox tipped over the bar, after the Norwegian had weaved his way through the Jags defence.","Kris Commons fired Celtic into the lead on the stroke of half-time .

Now that Battle of Britain – potentially at Wembley Stadium – may never take place. So says Khan's father Shah as his son gets ready to finally confirm the over-criticised Chris Algieri as his opponent in New York on the same night when Brook will be defending his world welterweight title against Gavin at London's O2 Arena on May 20 . Promoter Eddie Hearn (centre) stands behind Kell Brook (left) and Frankie Gavin at the O2 Arena . Amir Khan celebrates his victory over Devon Alexander at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas last year . Shah Khan, who also supervises affairs, says: 'Kell could have had his chance against Amir right now if Eddie Hearn had toned it down. But instead of being patient he's been so disrespectful. 'If he carries on like that the Brook fight will not take place. He keeps shouting about how much the fight is worth but I don't care about the money. For Amir it's more about the big fights and his status in boxing. 'Amir's told Kell he will be happy to box him in the next year but Eddie's jeopardising that. He carries on calling us out and insulting us. Any more of that and it will be all over. 'Kell has said plenty, too. But we don't think this is his fault. He seems a good lad. It's Eddie putting the words in his mouth.' Initially, Hearn's provocative manoeuvres came as a surprise to the rival camp. Khan Snr says: 'Eddie will talk reasonably in the negotiating room. Pleasant with us. But as soon as he gets outside he starts with the nonsense.' Hearn (centre) speaks during a press conference to announce the fight between Brook and Gavin . Khan (right) poses for a photo alongside father Shah (centre) and brother Haroon in Sheffield in 2013 . The Khans see a telling parable with the way Junior Witter's critical harassment of Ricky Hatton offended the Hitman. 'Ricky became annoyed and it was hard to blame him,' says Shah. 'It was a fight he would have been happy to take but when the words became unpleasant he walked away for good. 'And what's happened to Witter after that? Virtually nothing. Now he's more less forgotten. I can see the same happening to Kell. 'Yet Brook is a fight Amir would have been more than happy to have. We feel it's a fairly comfortable fight for us. Kell has done OK but we sense that as soon as he comes up against a fighter of Amir's elite level he will be found out. 'Eddie needs to calm down.' If what is being described as the biggest domestic fight in waiting is to become reality, it is over to you Mr Hearn. Eddie, a fellow columnist here at Sportsmail, has pushed through a number of matches with his outspoken pubic challenges. But last week he drew a frosty response from Carl Frampton and his legendary promoter Barry McGuigan when he brandished at them a cheque for £1.5million for the Belfast Jackal to meet his man Scott Quigg in a world super-bantamweight title unification fight. Brook (left) and Gavin (right) go face to face as promoter Hearn looks on in the background . Hearn displays the cheque for £1.5m to set-up Scott Quigg's fight with Carl Frampton . Khan has taken flak for lining up Algieri for his next fight, after the New Yorker was decked six times en route to an embarrassing, wipe-out defeat by Manny Pacquaio. But Algieiri did defeat the previously feared Russian puncher Ruslan Provodnikov to win the world lightweight title, which he still holds. And Khan says: 'Gavin hasn't done anything to compare with that. Sadly Frankie's recent performances against comparatively weak opposition have been anything but convincing. Good luck to him getting the pay-night but he's done nothing to justify this world title shot.' Khan jumped the gun in announcing Algieri and the May 20 date at the Barclays Center in New York, since his advisor Al Haymon was still finalising the deal. Chris Algieri (left) takes on Manny Pacquiao in a WBO welterweight title bout in Macau last year . But all seems to be in place now and the official statement should come this week. Khan was criticised, also, for allegedly declining the IBF offer of a final eliminator against Tim Bradley for Brook's belt. Khan Snr says: 'We couldn't really see the point of an eliminator a fight which Brook is so desperate to have.' His son was also accused of being less than truthful for saying he knew nothing about the offer. But there are suggestions that the secretive Haymon dismissed the IBF offer out of hand, without informing Khan. Paul Smith, having bravely lost his two challenges to Arthur Abraham in Germany, now finds himself in pole position for a third successive joust against a reigning world super-middleweight champion. Only this time the elder of Liverpool's fine family of four fighting brothers will not be boxing for a title, even though it is against a far more formidable champion. Andre Ward, still ranked by many among the top five pound-for-pound boxers in the world despite 17 months out of the ring, sees Smith as the ideal warm-up opponent, possibly before a rematch with Carl Froch. Paul Smith (right) throws a punch towards Arthur Abraham during their title fight in Berlin in February . Virgil Hunter, California-based trainer of both Ward and Amir Khan, says: 'Smith is who we want and I'm told it's a done deal. But it won't be for Andre's belt even though it will be over the 12-round championship distance.' The WBA have ordered their two super-middle world champions – Ward 'super,' Froch 'regular' – to meet in a unification fight. Froch declared willingness if Ward returns the compliment by travelling to the UK, having won their first meeting in the US. Ward said he would make the away trip but only as far as London, not to Nottingham where Froch has long desired to box on his hometown City Ground. Andre Ward (left) poses with his many title belts after defeating Edwin Rodriguez in November 2013 . Hunter declares: 'Andre would have gladly taken Carl straight away.' But now it appears the WBA are granting the so-called Son of God licence to shake off the ring rust where he almost always fights, in his native city across the Bay from San Francisco. Froch, meanwhile, is turning his attention to his other remaining ambition before retirement – a first appearance on the Las Vegas Strip, against the namesake son of Mexican legend Julio Cesar Chavez. Step into Oakland's Oracle Arena, Paul Smith. Good luck to him, in every sense of the phrase.

A woman has been branded a 'menace to the community' after she posed as both a council warden and a church official to bluff her way into sheltered housing complexes to steal from vulnerable residents. Julie Walters, 49, has been jailed for two and a half years after she pretended to be a trusted official to dupe elderly victims out of cash. She was caught by police after she was spotted on CCTV loitering in the communal hall of a retirement property near to the Old Trafford football ground in Manchester before an 80-year-old man and an 81-year-old woman were fleeced in two separate attacks. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters of Withington, Manchester, hanging around outside the complex after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court. The court heard how the first victim, a man aged 81, was targeted at about midday on February 25 this year when he was walking back to his sheltered accommodation. He saw Walters get out of a taxi and she asked him for money, claiming she needed to pay the taxi and then go into town. Mistakenly thinking she was one of the wardens, he gave her about £30 in cash. The next day she returned to the man’s address, claiming she worked there, and needed to check his bathroom. After tricking her way inside, she stole his wallet and £100 in cash. Walters struck again on March 2 at the home of an 80-year-old man who lives at another retirement home. She falsely claimed she was from the church which convinced the man to let her inside. Walters then rifled through the kitchen, stealing his wallet containing between £50 to £60 in cash. Later that day and at the same retirement home, Walters targeted the home of an 81-year-old woman, claiming she was from 'the council' and needed to use the toilet. Once inside, she stole a £5 note from the woman’s handbag but was caught red-handed. When confronted she simply put the note on the coffee table and left. Walters was identified on the CCTV footage by a beat police officer and she was arrested on March 4. Investigations showed she had booked taxis to drop her off and then pick her up at times and locations matching those of the three burglaries. Today, police issued CCTV images of Walters hanging around outside a complex, where she targeted two residents, after she admitted three counts of burglary at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court . After the case Detective Sergeant Rachel Smith of Greater Manchester Police said: “Walters is devoid of conscience and scruples. “She is also extremely manipulative, not only in terms of tricking her way into the homes of vulnerable people but also targeting those she thinks are too frail or elderly to recognise her or give evidence in court. “In fact, in this case, one of the victims did feel he was too old to go to court but thankfully the woman who caught her red-handed positively picked her out of an identity parade and that, combined with the CCTV and mobile phone evidence we found, created an overwhelming case against Walters. “I cannot overstate what a menace to the community Walters is but thanks to this excellent investigation, she is now starting a lengthy jail sentence and the streets are much safer with her behind bars. “I would also like to commend the victims for giving their statements despite some reservations about their age. 'By doing so, they have not only helped effect justice for themselves but also saved other potential victims a great deal of heartache.”","Julie Walters pretended to be trusted official to gain access to care homes .

I'm surprised they don't analyse it in the TV deals. I'm surprised a game of the same stature is played at the same time. There's a little conflict there. It's difficult to understand.' 'We would like it to be a unique competition that's played, especially a semi-final or final and don't want it to be conflicting with other competitions. It's a very big game (at Chelsea). It's a surprise to me.' Wenger admits a United win at Chelsea could open up the title race again. 'Mathematically yes,' he said. 'But we have to keep winning.' Klopp confirmed on Wednesday his intention to leave Dortmund at the end of the season after seven years in which the club won two Bundesliga titles and reached the Champions League final. It sparked a frenzy of speculation about whether the charismatic 47-year-old might be destined for England with Arsenal or Manchester City, where manager Manuel Pellegrini is feeling the heat after a poor run of form. Wenger hit out at the TV scheduling as Manchester United's trip to Chelsea clashes with the semi-final . Wenger has branded the 'circus' around Jurgen Klopp's resignation as 'ridiculous' 'I'm not an agency to place managers,' said Wenger, when asked about Klopp's announcement. 'I like every manager and respect, everybody. I find that circus a bit ridiculous. 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund. Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, they have the ability to keep their best players. They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Arsenal will have Jack Wilshere available for the semi-final against Reading, as he trained on Thursday with the club at their base. Wojciech Szczesny will start in the tie, and was also put through his paces during Arsenal's training session.

Tomasz Lazar spent hours photographing and interviewing adults who were ripped from their homes as children in the 1940s and forced to live thousands of miles away in Siberia. ""For me those faces are like maps,"" Lazar said. ""The more you look at them, the more you are discovering."" Soviet authorities invaded Poland during World War II and deported hundreds of thousands of Poles. Some were sent to prison camps in the frozen wilderness of central Russia. Many were children. In effect, Moscow stole much of an entire generation of young Poles, a handful of whom Lazar has located seven decades later. During Lazar's interviews, many of the survivors broke down in tears. ""It was very traumatic for them,"" he said. ""Some lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters -- killed by the Soviets."" Lazar remembers hearing 84-year-old Boguslaw Dokurno recall his grandfather's dying wish. Dokurno's grandfather asked his grandson to return home to Poland after his death to retrieve Polish soil and bring it back to his Siberian gravesite. Another exile, Sofia Bocian, told Lazar how her brother escaped their prison camp, leaving her with the horrifying experience of being interrogated by Soviet secret police.

16c3fea26b874fd94cfbb9730733b030fa2326b4,"The baby boom generation is set to leave a wave of funeral debt to its children and grandchildren, a report warns. The number of deaths every year in Britain – which have been falling for the past 40 years – will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as the lives of unprecedented numbers born in the post-baby boom come to an end. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers’ bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Loss of baby boomers: The number of UK deaths per will rise by 20 per cent over the next two decades, as funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past ten years . The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. ‘After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,’ it said. ‘As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.’ Expensive end: A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, an old age think tank has found . It added: ‘This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.’ Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: ‘More than half of UK households have less than £3,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. ‘We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.’ The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A ‘simple’ funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of £3,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost £2,000 more. An average ‘full works’ funeral now costs £5,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from £102 to £160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.","Number of UK deaths per will rise by 20% over the next two decades .

Pension firms said Britons remained baffled about how the radical changes worked, with many unaware of age restrictions or tax implications. Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity. And yesterday, the first people to cash in their pots began to receive their money. Scroll down for video . Since Monday, over-55s have been able to withdraw all or part of their pension pots instead of being forced to buy a regular pension income for life, known as an annuity . The Government had said that everyone over the age of 55 who wanted to take part in the new pension freedoms would be given a free half-hour session of guidance but just 300 advisers are available (file picture) But one major provider reported that customers in their 20s had been calling up to withdraw their retirement savings – unaware they were three decades too young. Others were unaware they faced a hefty tax bill if they removed all their cash at once. The confusion was not helped by a decision to pull the plug on television adverts promoting the Government's pensions helpline. The Treasury said that, ahead of the election, it had switched to a 'low level' advertising campaign for its Pension Wise guidance service and dropped its television adverts for almost two months. 'Purdah' rules bar Government advertising campaigns before a general election so that it does not promote the cause of a certain political party. But experts said barring TV adverts which raise awareness of the pension changes would punish consumers, some of whom were already confused by the changes. Experts fear pensioners could be vulnerable  if they do not receive proper advice regarding pension plans now that over-55s can cash in their pensions and spend them  instead of being forced to buy an annuity (file image) David Trenner, of Intelligent Pensions, said it was 'crazy to stop advertising Pension Wise under Purdah rules', while Catriona Standingford, who runs a financial training firm, asked on Twitter: Shouldn't the consumer/taxpayer come first?.' The Treasury said the service will only be advertised through print and digital advertising for April and most of May. Pensions firm Fidelity Worldwide Investment said it had taken 1,300 calls about the pension freedoms in the last week alone. But several calls a day have been from people under-55 trying to access their cash, including a 23-year-old who mistakenly believed they could 'get hold of their pot now'. Richard Parkin, of Fidelity, said: 'Misunderstandings exist around when you can access your funds. 'Since the new freedoms were announced, we've received a steady number of calls from people under the age of 55 who think they can access their funds under the new rules.'","Pension firms said Britons remain baffled about how radical changes work .

ee328187df02d98bb236fa9f144c027e37dba9b3,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN)A border guard was killed in a cross-boundary fire exchange with militants in Yemen this week, the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported Thursday -- marking Saudi Arabia's first publicly known military death since it launched airstrikes against rebels inside its southern neighbor. The clash occurred Wednesday night at the border in southwestern Saudi Arabia's Asir region, when militants in a mountainous area on the Yemeni side fired on Saudi border troops, prompting them to return fire, SPA reported. Besides the slain border guard -- identified as Cpl. Salman Ali Yahya al-Maliki -- 10 others suffered injuries that were not life-threatening, the Saudi media outlet said. On Thursday, Houthi rebels seized the presidential palace in the southern Yemeni port city of Aden, a neutral security official and two Houthi commanders in Aden told CNN. The palace had been where President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi, who fled the country last month, had stayed for a period of time after Houthis secured control of the capital, Sanaa, in January. According to the security official, Houthis now control most large districts in Aden amid ongoing clashes. Yemeni special forces, considered pro-Houthi and loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, arrived in Aden on Thursday in an attempt ""to secure the city,"" a Saudi official with knowledge of the situation told CNN. ""I can now confirm that it is not Saudi special forces who have landed but Yemeni special forces loyal to Saleh who landed by small boat. They are few in number and have made their way to the old parliament building,"" the intelligence official said. U.S. Navy warships, meanwhile, were patrolling off Yemen in search of suspicious shipping in the region, in particular any weapons shipments from Iran to the Houthi rebels they are supporting in Yemen, a U.S. defense official told CNN. The Navy on Wednesday came across a Panamanian-registered cargo ship that had left an Iranian port, the official said. Based on the route of the ship from Iran to Yemen, the Navy declared it a ""vessel of interest"" and requested permission from the captain to search it. The ship was found to be carrying cement and construction materials, the official said. It was sent on its way. The offshore area has been a route for weapons smuggling into Yemen, as well as Sudan and Gaza, so the Navy has maintained a regular surveillance presence there. The official said that increased fighting in the last several days in southern Yemen has resulted in other ships trying to dock to help civilians leave the country. Marie Claire Feghali, an International Committee of the Red Cross spokeswoman in Sanaa, described events in Aden as ""extremely fluid and very, very complicated."" ""Hospitals are still struggling, running out of supplies. So are we,"" she said. ""We cannot move much in Aden due to the intense fighting and chaos."" A hospital near heavy fighting was forced to shut down. Officials: Al Qaeda fighters free 270 from Yemeni prisons .

And speaking after second-half goals from Mame Diouf and substitute Charlie Adam saw his side roar back after Morgan Schneiderlin had given Ronald Koeman’s Southampton a deserved lead, manager Hughes added that he was hopeful of keeping Begovic at the club. Stoke City have opened talks over a contract extension for in-demand goalkeeper Asmir Begovic . Begovic is highly-rated and has attracted interest from several top clubs, including La Liga's Real Madrid .

Stoke midfielder Charlie Adam scores during the comeback win over Southampton in the Premier League . Jonathan Walters (left) congratulates fellow Stoke striker Mame Biram Diouf (right) after his goal on Saturday . ‘We want to be a team that’s consistently in the top ten,’ said a beaming Hughes whose side rose to ninth in the table. ‘To be able to do that you need key players in key areas of the field and obviously goalkeeper is a key position in any good team and Asmir has been exceptional for us for a long time now.’ Both Manchester clubs have watched the 27-year-old but Hughes thinks Stoke have a chance of persuading him to stay. The win over Southampton on Saturday was Stoke’s first over them since February 2008 when an own goal from Darren Powell and efforts from Ryan Shawcross and Mamady Sidibe secured a 3-2 triumph. ‘We’re talking and those talks are going to be concluded in the summer,’ he said. ‘Hopefully they are going to be concluded in our favour.’ Next up for Saints, who missed the chance to close the gap on Manchester City in fourth place to two points, is a home meeting with Tottenham - and the return to St Mary’s of former boss Mauricio Pochettino. Captain Jose Fonte believes it is a big match because of the race for Europe rather than the visit of the Argentine. ‘It’s because it’s Tottenham,’ said the centre-half. ‘They are close in the table and we want to finish above them.

In his column for skysports.com, Merson wrote: 'If Andros Townsend can get in then it opens it up for anybody. We are not picking players who are playing well for their clubs – he got taken off after 30 minutes the other week against United. 'The England manager is there watching the game and he still gets picked. Townsend and Kyle Walker were the worst two players on the pitch. 'How can you tell me that a manager goes and watches Man United against Tottenham, the winger gets taken off after 30 minutes, the winger from the other team absolutely rinses the full-back for England and Ashley Young doesn’t get in the squad?' ‘He said when the squad was announced that I should be “nowhere near the squad”. It didn’t really annoy me, but gave me the extra incentive to silence a few critics. Hopefully I’ve done that as I always have.’ Merson had made his comments on Sky Sports when Roy Hodgson named the players for games against Lithuania and Italy. The 1-1 draw in Turin had not long ended when Townsend (below) tweeted to his 285,000 followers: ‘Not bad for a player that should be “nowhere near the squad” ay @PaulMerse?’ The Tottenham’s winger’s father Troy joined in, too, tweeting: “Oh ye of little faith #Merson get in.’ They could also have pointed out that Townsend’s screamer was his third for England, taking him level with Merson. ‘You can never stop proving things to people,’ said Townsend. ‘But I think every time I’ve put on an England shirt I have done myself justice, I have done Roy Hodgson justice and the nation justice. I was a bit disappointed with his comments but I have come on the pitch and silenced them.' Sky Sports pundit Paul Merson (centre) criticised Townsend's call-up to the England squad last week . Harry Kane congratulates his Tottenham team-mate Townsend after the final whistle in Turin . Good-natured north London Twitter skirmishing aside, there will have been a few Spurs supporters who understood Merson’s point. Townsend’s form has been inconsistent, and having seen him come off the bench to score for England they will wonder why he cannot do it more often for Tottenham. ‘I can’t put my finger on it or tell you what it is,’ admitted Townsend, when asked about the contrast. ‘The (England) manager has always given me confidence to go and express myself and play my natural game. ‘I wouldn’t say it’s my best form but this is the best form I’ve produced this season. I have had a few injury problems but I’m over the worst of that. ‘I’m slowly building my confidence back to where it was and hopefully from now until the end of the season I can get more games for Spurs and England and get back to the football I was producing last season.’ After long-range goals against Montenegro and San Marino, Townsend enjoyed the one he flashed past Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday. It came from his weaker, right foot, against elite opposition and he made a beeline for Buffon after the match to ask for his shirt as a souvenir. ‘He is a top goalkeeper — one of the best to ever play the game — so to score past him I thought was no mean feat,’ said Townsend. ‘As soon as the whistle went, I thought I’d go and get his shirt because it is a real night to savour for me.’ Roy Hodgson was also impressed with Townsend after the Tottenham winger's fine goal after the break .","Andros Townsend scored the equaliser in England's 1-1 draw with Italy .

Due to its position at the back of the brain treatment can be particularly difficult and it is impossible to operate on, making prognosis poor. After doctors found the tumour just after the teenager's 18th birthday she was told she had just two years left. But in September, as her condition worsened, she was told she would not last until December. The Mount St Joseph freshman devoted her final year to playing basketball, raising money for cancer research, and inspiring others. She played four games, raising $1.5million for pediatric cancer and leaving a legacy of fundraising that will be continued after her death. When her condition began to worsen and she became too ill to play, Hill helped out the team as a coach. Lauren Hill was a keen basketball player but she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which was inoperable and significantly changed her appearance as she resolved to carry on playing in the final months of her life (right) The treatment she had significantly altered her appearance but she was determined to keep playing and raising funds for as along as she could. Before the season started, the US Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. This was noted again at the women's Final Four a week ago. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. Basketball star LeBron James posted an emotional farewell letter to the teenager via Twitter on Friday, just hours after she passed away from her rare tumor. Hill is seen shooting a lay up during the November 2 game - her first for the Mount St Joseph's team . During her first NCAA college basketball game on November Hill gave a thumbs-up as she holds the ball . 'She made you think:"" What am I doing with my life?"" said Lexy Saraswate, 19, a Xavier student who volunteered to work at the memorial service. ""How can I be a better person?"" 'Just her courage. I felt that was the thing: What do you do when you're staring death in the face? She set a goal for herself and accomplished it, even surpassed it. She's an inspiration.' Hill's casket was brought by a hearse to Xavier's Cintas Center - the site where she made a left-handed layup to open a Division III game on November 2. The match was moved forward to this date with permission of the NCAA because of her declining condition. Hill parents, Brent (left, front) and LIsa (right) entered the Cintas Center for their daughter's memorial . Hill's high school basketball team, the Lawrenceburg Tigers, carried her jersey and a net into the memorial . Memorabilia from Hill's basketball career including a ball, net and her jersey, were placed by the casket . The public memorial was held at Xavier University in Cincinnati, with Hill's casket decorated with flowers . Mr and Mrs Hill (right) followed the casket at the conclusion of the hour-long memorial service in Cincinnati . The arena was packed for the game, which started with a set play to get her a left-handed layup. She also made a right-handed layup late in the game, sealing the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. The backboard and basket were off to the side, with the attached game clock and shot clock set to 22 — her number. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . Coach Dan Benjamin gently kissed her gray No. 22 jersey before stretching it over the casket. Former teammates dabbed their eyes with tissues as they sat in folding chairs on the floor. A few thousand people stood silently in the stands. 'She has revealed to us that one person can make a difference,' said Dr. Mariko DeWire, one of her physicians. 'She truly is our victorious hero.' A video of the layup she made only 17 seconds into Mount St. Joseph's 66-55 win over Hiram College in the season-opening game was also played. In a highly personal one hour ceremony songs from the basketball player's iPod were played. The second song on her playlist was James Taylor's 'You've Got A Friend.' One of her favorite songs — Katy Perry's 'Roar' — was played as her casket was wheeled out to a standing ovation. Hill will be buried in a private service on Wednesday. Family photos flanked the casket, along with a photo of her in a cape and a quote from actor Christopher Reeve: 'A hero is an ordinary individual who finds the strength to persevere in spite of overwhelming obstacles.' Hill tried to make the last months of her life about helping and inspiring other people. Through a nonprofit foundation, she helped to raise roughly $1.5 million for research into pediatric cancer. Shortly before she died, she set a goal of raising $2.2 million — matching her uniform number. Hill's team mates at Mount St Joseph University gathered to remember the teenager and her efforts . Mourners were played a video which showed her achievements during her successful basketball career . People gathered to attend the one hour long memorial service at Xavier University in Cincinnati . The fundraising campaign will continue through the school and the foundation. A number of people have praised the teenager's courage and determination as she battled her condition. 'Lauren chose to be the victor,' said the Reverend Corey Potts from her church in Indiana. 'When she was in the hospital, I went to see Lauren expecting to cheer her up. And she cheered me up.'

ce02bb0eabbde2c97e451d4c65aff8a64a722a3a,"This year has seen a rash of massive dust storms around the world that have led to travel chaos and blocked out sunlight - but experts cannot pinpoint the reason behind the spate. This week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual 'apocalyptic' dust storm, known in Arabic as a haboob, struck Belarus, turning day to night, and China has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year. Some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms, but one European scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable. Dark clouds start forming over the city of Soligorsk, Belarus, as a sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . A raging sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city . The footage of the dust storm in Belarus, filmed from a high rise apartment, shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, reported RT. Earlier this month Britain was shrouded in a cloud of Saharan dust, known as 'blood rain,' as the temperatures soared. Blurred: The Shard, one of London's most iconic buildings, is pictured shrouded in 'blood rain' earlier this month . In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm (pictured) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude . Dr Steven Godby, a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at Nottingham Trent University, explained how these events can occur. 'The dust is produced from source areas in North Africa, incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the UK. 'However, the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources. And incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of April showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms  devoured a city in China's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north-west of the country being the fourth this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. On April 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. The Middle East has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year. This week Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran experienced severe dust storms and last week the Arabian Peninsula was hit by a sandstorm the size of the U.S. And in February raging sandstorms engulfed Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt causing the worst Israeli air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the Mediterranean Sea. The sandstorm hit Egypt after unusually warm and sunny weather for a February day, and the sky over downtown Cairo turned yellow and blotted out the sun, limiting visibility . Hazy: The Egyptian capital was transformed by the sandstorm while Alexandria and nearby Dekheila ports were closed because of the weather . Red alert: The sandstorm in Egypt gave the country a Martian look . The storm, made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa also engulfed Cairo. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years. The sandstorm that engulfed the Arabian Peninsula, meanwhile, wrecked havoc across the area, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agulló, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them. He said: ‘We are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring, mainly from satellites, and forecast systems, in the last five to 10 years, and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions, in recent decades, increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes.’ He added: ‘Our longest dust records over the North Atlantic, downwind from the Sahara desert, which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes, but we don't really see positive trends.’ Severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in Egypt's capital city . 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world’s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam.

221ddd32e148ca3c95b93d7c5070133d719c36cc,"FIFA presidential candidate Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein has made a formal rotation of the World Cup between the continents one of the key elements of his manifesto and says he can see a tournament being jointly hosted by several different nations. Prince Ali, a current FIFA vice-president from Jordan, said he could envisage a World Cup being played in different countries - or even in different confederations - in a similar way to Euro 2020 which is being played in 13 nations. In his manifesto, which he launched on Monday, Prince Ali has also warned against any decision on expanding the World Cup from its current 32 countries, or a re-allocation of places, being taken for purely political reasons to try to drum up votes for the FIFA presidency. Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, a FIFA presidential candidate, wants to see the World Cup rotated between nations . Prince Ali, who aims to replace  Sepp Blatter (right), warned against expanding the World Cup from 32 teams . Prince Ali is standing for FIFA president alongside former Portugal and Real Madrid player Luis Figo . He is standing against current president Sepp Blatter, Michael van Praag from Holland and former Portugal international Luis Figo. In terms of World Cup rotation, Prince Ali said the confederations should take turns hosting the tournament. 'The principle is that it should be rotated among the confederations but it still has to be based on the best bids,' he said. 'But we have to be open-minded. I think it is also possible that two countries from different confederations could co-host the World Cup. Look at Europe in 2020 - a number of different regions or countries could host the World Cup - it's in the past now but potentially the Gulf could have had a World Cup due to its close proximity.' FIFA has announced it will make a decision on the allocation of World Cup places at an executive committee meeting the day after the presidential election on May 29. Prince Ali said much more consultation was needed before any decision should be made. He added: 'I am very hesitant about people playing politics with the most important flagship event of FIFA and possibly of sport in the world. 'We need to speak to all the stakeholders, including the sponsors. People are making promises to enlarge the World Cup but in 2022 they are making the World Cup shorter in terms of time frame. We cannot end up with a situation where mistakes are made again.' Prince Ali has also promised greater transparency, including making public the salary of the FIFA president and executive committee members. He also believes that the minutes of FIFA executive committee meetings should be made public. He also wants an investigation into how the US television rights for the 2026 World Cup were awarded to Fox without a tender process or any discussion with the FIFA executive committee. FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke has said FIFA 'did what it had to do' to prevent any possible legal action from the broadcaster in relation to the 2022 rights after the Qatar World Cup was moved to the winter. Prince Ali, who insists there is a real appetite for change among FIFA associations, said large sums of money for football had potentially been lost. 'Unfortunately I was not made aware of it and I have been trying to find out what is going on,' he said. Michael van Praag (right), from Holland, is the remaining presidential candidate . 'Something went wrong and we need to get to the bottom of it. 'It needs to have a proper tendering process which is good practice in any organisation in the world. 'We are talking about a large sum of money that future generations will potentially have lost because of decisions or misadministration taking place at the moment by people who will probably not be around at that time.'","Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein launched his election manifesto on Monday .

84947a18ea64d802e006d7ebe066cff5fdc75651,"You'd think that being a chef, I'd want to escape the toils of the kitchen while on holiday - but the opposite is true. I jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration. And where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious Grenada? The island is known for its zesty spices and self-sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk. Heading west: Rosemary spent a week on Grenada, where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available . Meat and fish are plentiful and, because the soil is very fertile, the vegetables, fruit and salads are the glossiest you'll ever see. Grenada's seasons are similar to our own, which means cauliflower, broccoli and pumpkins in spring. Exotic fruit - mangoes, star fruit, passion fruit, melon and skin-up, which is like a lychee — are the stars of the summer. Autumn heralds guavas, sweetsop (sugar apples) and soursop (similar to pawpaw), and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple, which is a Caribbean version of a peach. Sumptuous sands: Grenada is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of Grand Anse . I am staying in the southwest of the island at Mount Cinnamon on Grand Anse Beach, near the charming town of St George. It offers well-equipped self-catering villas, each with its own terrace and wonderful views of the bay. You can cook your own supper, but the bubbling restaurant scene is difficult to resist. Beach bars abound. I especially liked the Beach Cabana at Mount Cinnamon, where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night. People come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach, at which local musicians play. This is the Caribbean at its best. Just beware of those generous drinks measures. The restaurant Yolo (which is text speakfor 'you only live once') specialises in sushi and Asian cuisine. I order plums, mangoes, cherries and avocados, all picked that day. The fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare, its signature dish, almost leaps off the plate. Come dine with me: Grenada is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes . The next day, I watch a fish cookery demonstration at Mount Cinnamon: a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut, ginger, lime, spices, peppers and chives, wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire, and served with delicious breadfruit chips. If you want to mingle with Grenadans, there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market. St George's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island. In a 17th-century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit, exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory. Here, I learn to cook the Grenadan national dish, oil down. This is a hearty, one-pot meal with salted meat, chicken, breadfruit, callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings. The whole lot is stewed in coconut milk. Delicious! The food odyssey continues in the evening when I visit BB's Crabback Caribbean restaurant, overlooking the harbour. My favourite place to eat on the beach is La Sagesse, on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath-temperature sea. A place to cool your heels: Rosemary stayed at Grenada's elegant Mount Cinnamon resort . No tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the River Antione Rum Distillery - the last one in the Caribbean to make the drink from cane sugar, as they did in the 18th century. Rum is not to my taste, but it's interesting to see the process behind it. Belmont in the Grand Etang area is more to my liking. It's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm. We taste goat's cheese and salt fish fritters, a popular local dish. Even the governor grows her own vegetables. Her Excellency Dame Cecile la Grenade is the first woman governor on the island. She received an OBE from the Queen for the food business started by her mother. Her extensive gardens are full of exotic vegetables, fruit and spices — a dream to any aspiring cook. Even the paths are made of crushed nutmeg shells. A fitting tribute to this fragrant and friendly island. British Airways (0844 493 0787, www.ba.com) flies to Grenada from £562 return.

d5e3add9f887075a83c369474811874d0abe37dc,"The family of one ANZAC veteran were thrilled to receive news from a stranger this week that their relative's war medal had been unearthed in an east Melbourne Park. Fossicker Ashley Manzie was combing the park with his metal detector when he discovered a medal belonging to Frederick George Biddulph, who served with the 23rd Australian Infantry Battalion at Gallipolli between 1914 and 1915. Mr Manzie posted photos of the silver medal to an online fossicking forum, which led him to Sydney man Stephen Norton - Biddulph's great-nephew. 'At first I thought it was a scam or someone trying to sell me something,' Mr Norton told Daily Mail Australia. 'I just couldn't believe it - I thought wow - and then I was really confused.' Rare find: Ashley Manzie unearthed the WW1 star medal when he was combing a Melbourne park with his metal detector last week. Mr Norton, who has been researching his family history for 'a very long time' says the discovery has raised more questions than it has answered. He thinks the inscribed medal doesn't belong to Frederick at all, but to his brother Lewis William Biddulph. 'Frederick never went to war. He'd lost two fingers blowing up fish so he  wouldn't have been accepted to fight,' said Mr Norton. 'We think his younger brother Lewis, who had a slight hearing problem, may have used his name to sign up.' It means that a grave in Melbourne's Springvale Cemetery bearing a plaque with Frederick's name is probably not his either. Instead, it records the date of Lewis's death, or 'Bunny' as he was called in the family 'because he was so fast.' Norton recently discovered that Frederick had actually died nine years before 'Bunny' in New Zealand. Frederick Biddulph's plaque at Melbourne's Springvale cemetery probably belongs to his brother Lewis, who joined the army in his name because he had poor hearing . Frederick Biddulph (left) pictured with Stephen Norton's grandfather, Thomas Driscoll, and another brother, Bill . Stephen Norton says tracing the family history has been difficult because it seems the men changed their names a number of times in order to get into the service. He says the only thing he knows for sure is that there were three brothers who went off to WW1 from Tasmania - and that they all came back alive. The other brothers were Benjamin William, who was awarded the Gallipoli Medal, and David Tasman. According to national records, the 23rd Battalion with which Bunny served landed at Anzac cove in September 1914. The troops manned Lone Pine, 'one of the most trying parts of the Anzac frontline' until they left Gallipoli in December 1915. Norton says his own grandfather - Bunny's brother - fought in the Battle of Fromelles in France. 'He was a machine-gunner who was caught on the wire and spent years as a Prisoner of War in Germany before making it back to Australia,' Norton says. 'Somehow they all made it home.' From the archives: Frederick (left) whose name is inscribed on the WW1 medal, never joined the army because he lost two fingers 'blowing up fish' before the war. The lost medal is instead thought to have belonged to his brother, Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says it made his year to be able to return the medal to a living relative ahead of  the ANZAC Day Centenary this weekend . Some of Manzie's other finds with the silver war medal . Fossicker Ashley Manzie says he was 'blown away' to unearth the medal so close to the 100 year ANZAC Day anniversary. He says he found Stephen Norton after 'researching his heart out' with other members of the Australian Metal Detecting and Relic Hunting online forum. 'Definitely a roamer,' he posted to the forum after finding a slew of documents on Frederick Biddulph in the National archives. 'I found out that he was discharged from the Army as medically unfit when he returned to Australia in 1917, that he was diagnosed with Myocarditis (inflammation of the heart),' Manzie told Daily Mail Australia. Manzie also found letters from Biddulph's mother in Tasmania, appealing to the authorities for information about her son. 'Not knowing he whereabouts:' Ashley Manzie discovered this letter from Frederick Biddulph's mother asking the authorities for information on the whereabouts of her son . Did Mrs Biddulph ever make contact with her son Frederick or was she looking for Bunny? 'I don't know, I don't know if she even knew about the name swaps,' says Stephen Norton. 'Dad's the only one from that era who would know - and I was hoping to be able to drag more out of him - but he's 94 now and his memory isn't what it was.' For Norton, the discovery raises the question of the other two medals that the records say were awarded to 'Frederick'. 'This is the only one that has come to light, maybe the others are with his family, I don't even know if he had children and if there's other family out there,' he says. Stephen Norton doesn't know whether Private Frederick George Biddulph's mother ever made contact with her son, or his brother Lewis 'Bunny' Biddulph, when they returned to Australia from the war . Stephen Norton says he will proudly wear the newly-found medal, alonsgide those of his grandfather and his own father, to the Marylands RSL Anzac Day dawn service this weekend. Ashley Manzie says the discovery has 'made his year.' 'It made not just my day but my year when I found out that I could return the medal to a living relative. Especially being the 100 year anniversary of ANZAC,' he said. 'All this history and amazing story all from a beep on my detector in a park! Lest we forget.'","A Melbourne man has unearthed a WW1 medal  with his metal detector .

Captured by a visitor to the Dierenrijk zoo, the lion can be seen inserting its head into the barrel and attempting to retrieve a piece of meat. Zoo keepers place food in barrels to stimulate the lions, as it replicates the challenges faced when the animals feed in the wild. The animal, hoping to beat two other lions to the food, reaches in too far and suddenly gets its head stuck.

43714dad35c2ec64d16ef6bdd17853a2f5eb0744,"A bizarre new dinosaur with bat-like wings has been discovered by a farmer in China and is now helping to shed new light on the evolution of flight. Palaeontologists in China say the impeccably preserved fossil belongs to a small dinosaur thought to have lived 160 million years ago. The strange-looking creature had small stiff feathers on its body and long finger-like bones extending from each wrist that were covered in a membrane like a bat’s wing. Scroll down for video . The new dinosaur, named Yi qi (shown above in the artists reconstruction), had unusual bristle-like feathers and bat-like wings that were covered in a membrane. The dinosaur may have been able to glide and even flap . Scientists believe the dinosaur, which they have named Yi qi, meaning ‘strange wing’, may have glided or even flown through the air. The discovery has provided new insight into how vertebrates first began to take to the air. A new lineage of dinosaur that grazed on plants, despite being closely related to notorious carnivore Tyrannosaurus rex, has been discovered in Chile. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of characteristics, including its small skull and feet. These features are more like those seen on long-neck dinosaurs. The animal is proving to be an evolutionary jigsaw puzzle because it belongs to the theropod group of dinosaurs - which were predominantly carnivorous and included the famous meat eaters Velociraptor, Carnotaurus and Tyrannosaurus, from which birds today evolved - but was a vegetarian. The presence of herbivorous theropods was up until now only known in close relatives of birds, but Chilesaurus shows  a meat-free diet was acquired much earlier than first thought. The dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Period, around 145 million years ago, is named after the country where it was discovered, and Diego Suárez, who discovered the bones. Palaeontologists are referring to Chilesaurus diegosuarezi (illustrated) as a 'platypus' dinosaur because of its bizarre combination of features . Researchers say the dinosaur, which would have weighted just 13 ounces (380g) and was 33cm (12 inches) long with a wings that spanned 60cm (23 inches), may have been an early evolutionary experiment with flight. Yi qi belongs the group of carnivorous dinosaurs known as the therapods - which includes Tyranosaurus rex and velociraptor. These dinosaurs are thought to have been the ancestors of modern birds. But unlike modern birds, Yi qi was found to have a strange extra  bone extending backwards from its wrist, rather like an entirely separate group of animals that learned to fly - the bats. Professor Xing Xu, one of the world’s leading prolific palaeontologists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing and who led the work, said: 'This is really something for me. It is the most unexpected discovery I ever made. 'Birds are descended from dinosaurs, but how exactly the transition occurred is not really clear. This new discovery is a new species of these bird like dinosaurs. 'This dinosaur is totally different. It has totally different wings from all other birds and their close relatives. 'Close to the origin of birds there are many lineages trying to get into the air but there was only one group that succeeded. 'I would have said this example shows how much experimentation close to this transition.' The discovery comes in the same week as researchers announced the discovery of a bizarre vegetarian relative of the T-Rex. The Yi qi fossil was discovered by a local farmer in Mutoudeng, in Qinglong County, Hebei Province in China. The fossil has preserved stiff filamentous features on the forelimb and hindlimb, along with patches of the membrane that once stretched across its wings. However, it was the strange wrists and long rod-like bones that extended from them that baffled the attention of the palaeontologists. There are three main groups of flying vertebrates - the birds, which evolved from dinosaurs, pterosaurs that were flying reptiles that existed alongside the dinosarus, and the bats, which are mammals that evolved after the extinction of the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Most winged avian dinosaurs to be discovered so far all have wing structures that are similar to those of modern birds. However, Yi qi, which is pronounced 'ee chee', appears to be a weird hybrid between a dinosaur and a bat. This suggests that at the time several different types of winged dinosaurs evolved wings in an attempt to fly. The fossil of Yi qi (above) was so well preserved that bristle-like feathers and the remains of its membrane wings could be seen around the bones. The strange long bone extending from the wrist was highly unusual . This close up of the skull of Yi qi, which weighed just 13 ounces (380g), show oval like feathers near the head . Analysis by Professor Xu and his colleagues, which is published in the journal Nature, suggest that it is likely the dinosaur glided, perhaps like modern flying squirrels. The dinosaur lacked the strong muscle attachments to the forelimb bones and its bone structure would have interfered with the flapping and rotating movements needed during powered flight. Instead it may have launched itself from elevated perches and glided to the ground. If it did flap its wings it would probably have only been able to fly over short distances. But Professor Xu said: 'We thought giving this animal a name meaning ""strange wing"" was appropriate, because no other bird or dinosaur has a wing of the same kind . 'We don’t know if Yi qi was flapping, or gliding, or both, but it definitely evolved a wing that is unique in the context of the transition from dinosaurs to birds.' It is likely that the conclusions will be controversial with other evolutionary biologists, but it could prove hugely valuable in unravelling how birds evolved from their dinosaur ancestors. Professor Zheng Xiaoting, from Linyi University in Shandong who also took part in the study, said: 'Yi qi lived in the Jurassic, so it was a pioneer in the evolution of flight on the line to birds. 'It reminds us that the early history of flight was full of innovations, not all of which survived.' Dr Kevin Padian, a palaeontologist at the University of California Berkeley, warned that the animal may not have been able to fly at all. The fossil of Yi qi was discovered by a farmer working his fields in Mutoudeng in Qinglong County in China . The diagrams above show how  the wing of Yi qi (a) compares to other winged tetrapods (b and c) and the wing of a bat (d), the wing of a pigeon (e), the wing of a pterosaur (f) and the wing of a Japanese flying squirrel (g) He said: ‘As for gliding, if Yi qi’s styliform element helped to support a membranous aerofoil, it can be used to reconstruct the planform of the wing, as Xu and colleagues have done. ‘But in a gliding animal, the centre of lift of the aerofoil should be fairly congruent with the centre of gravity of the body — if the bulk of the animal’s weight falls too far behind the centre of lift, the back end will sag and the animal will stall. ‘That is clearly the case in the authors’ reconstruction of Yi qi, but an aerofoil that was swept back more, if anatomically possible, might have mitigated this problem. ‘Still, we are left in a quandary: an animal with a strange structure that looks as if it could have been used in flight, borne by an animal that otherwise shows no such tendencies. ‘And so far, there is no other plausible explanation for the function of this structure.’","Yi qi is thought to have lived 160 million years ago during the late Jurassic .

Either way Kate - who plans to give birth at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London - is now overdue and may have already spoken to doctors about the possibility of being induced. Scroll down for video . Previous royal birth: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge leave the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, in a proud moment with their newborn  son Prince George in July 2013 . Due date: Preparations have been made outside the Lindo Wing of the hospital (pictured yesterday) for the huge crowds expected to welcome the royal birth - with the Duchess said to be up to four days overdue . A source, whose children were born at the hospital’s exclusive Lindo Wing, told Daily Telegraph reporter Gordon Rayner: ‘The doctors don’t normally wait for more than a week. ‘They will probably already have been in touch with Kate, and talked about which day which suit her best to go in and be induced if the baby doesn’t arrive in the next couple of days.’ A Kensington Palace source said last week: 'We haven't ever confirmed a due date.'  Prince George was reportedly born three days late when he arrived at the hospital in July 2013. The joint favourite dates for the royal baby to be born are tomorrow and Tuesday at 6/1 - with Wednesday priced at 7/1 and Thursday 8/1, according to MailOnline's official betting partner Coral.

Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Sky News today: ‘I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.’ Around one in five deliveries in the UK is assisted.

Subs not used: Guerra, Ochoa, Torres, Filipenko . Booked: Sanchez, Damian Tissone . Goals: Juanmi 71' After just four minutes, Bale's game was over. The Welshman tenderly touched his calf and made a pulling motion with his hands to the bench as he left the pitch, which might imply internal muscle damage. Given that Karim Benzema was injured after a brutal Champions League encounter with City rivals Atletico Madrid in midweek, Bale's injury took the famous ""BBC"" strikeforce just down to C. That's the grade you'd give it too, in 2015, when compared to the performances of Barcelona's trio. Isco came in for Benzema, with the Frenchman's injury solving a problem that was brewing at Real Madrid, with Carlo Ancelotti having to choose between the former Malaga man, and James Rodriguez. The latter was chosen over the former to face Atletico, leading to stories of angst on Isco's part, but the issue was resolved by Benzema's timely absence. Modric, meanwhile, was taken out by a Recio challenge in the second half. It wasn't too fierce a tackle, but the Croatian took a strong knock to his knee and is now a doubt for Wednesday's second leg against Atletico. Malaga, having beaten Barcelona at Camp Nou earlier this season, and drawn with champions Atletico Madrid last week, are no La Liga whipping boys and they came to the Santiago Bernabeu with the belief they could win. Nordin Amrabat, on loan from Galatasaray, charged forward battling with Pepe, escaped the Real Madrid defender and crossed for Juanmi, but the forward couldn't connect and the chance was gone. The Dutchman stung Iker Casillas' fingertips with a strike from distance, the veteran stopper tipping his effort behind for a corner. Carlos Idriss Kameni was forced into a similar save at the other end, spectacularly flicking a header from Bale's replacement, Javier Hernandez, over the bar.

Ramos tucks the ball in to open the scoring for Real Madrid at the Bernabeu . The defender slides on his knees in front of the Real Madrid fans after netting . Real Madrid broke the deadlock in controversial fashion, when Ronaldo fired in a free kick from the left and Ramos rammed home from close range. The defender seemed fractionally offside, but despite Kameni's cries, the goal was allowed to stand. The Cameroonian goalkeeper was called into action again shortly afterwards, making a fine save down to his right from a James volley. With the most expensive player in the world off the pitch, the second most expensive was having fun. Ronaldo pulled off a quite ridiculous backheel-nutmeg on Marcos Angeleri. In the following minute Ramos had the ball in the net again, nodding home a Toni Kroos free-kick, but this time the officials spotted he was offside and ruled it out. Malaga flew down the other end and created a magnificent opportunity, which Sergi Darder blazed over the bar when he should have found the net. Juanmi's cross was half-cleared by Marcelo and Darder pounced, but lacked balance and spooned his strike off-target from eight yards. Amrabat, flying down the right early in the second half, tried to find Juanmi with a low cross, but it flew past the forward and Casillas gathered it. Ronaldo had the perfect opportunity to put the game beyond Malaga when James was taken down in the box by Samu Castillejo, but lacked his characteristic cool and fired the penalty against the left upright.

But Real Madrid didn't have long to wait for their second, with James scoring in spectacular fashion just a minute later. He played two one-twos on the edge of the box with Isco and Ronaldo, before lashing the ball into Kameni's top right corner. Game over? Not quite. Malaga were straight down the other end and on the scoresheet, with Roberto Rosales whipping the ball in from the right for Juanmi to head home. Amrabat had a chance to run through after a Marcelo mis-step - this was a rare poor performance for the Brazilian - but Kroos resorted to a blatant kick to stop him. The German went into the book, with the foul a symbol of how Madrid were struggling to prevent the Andalusian side from getting forward on the break. Ronaldo saw his second-half penalty hit the post after Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni had gone the right way . Real Madrid forward Ronaldo looks frustrated after missing a penalty during the second half . But Rodriguez soon doubled Real Madrid's lead just a couple of minutes after Ronaldo had missed the penalty . Ronaldo celebrates after securing the 3-1 victory late on after Malaga had pulled one back . Ronaldo's evening was saved on a personal level at the end, with Hernandez selflessly squaring the ball for the forward to tap home at the far post. His celebration was excessive, considering Madrid had essentially won the game and it was a simple finish, but that's what happens when you have to keep up with the Joneses. Or in this case, the Messis. The Argentine had scored for Barcelona earlier, so Ronaldo would have left frustrated had he not been able to replicate Messi's effort, grabbing his 39th goal of the season in La Liga, and his 50th in all competitions. Ronaldo became the first ever player to net 50 goals in five consecutive seasons, an incredible statistic, but Ancelotti's mind will now turn to Wednesday night and another incredible statistic. He has faced Atletico Madrid seven times so far this season and not won a single game. Will he be forced to try it without Modric and Bale in the eighth?","Sergio Ramos opened the scoring for Real Madrid in the first half at the Bernabeu .

Another sketch will see Ed Miliband's effigy join Ant and Dec to star in a show called 'I'm a Catastrophe... Get Me Out of Here' while a third will see Professor Brian Cox unearthing a new planet - on Kim Kardashian's backside. The six-part series will also feature Wayne Rooney, Beyonce, Harry Styles and The Great British Bake Off's Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry. Star of the show: Prince William's puppet is ready for the launch of new series, Newzoids . The real thing: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Stephen Lawrence Centre in south London . Royal stars: The Duke and Duchess will appear alongside Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall . The new show represents the first time that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have found themselves lampooned in a comedy show. But while it will all be new to William and Kate, other members of the Royal Family will remember their starring roles in Spitting Image. Among the most memorable was the jug-eared puppet of Prince Charles, who was famously shown talking on a telephone made of roses. Charles will return to puppet form in Newzoids, this time reimagined as a version of Gogglebox's Dominic Parker. The Duchess of Cornwall will be shown as a take on Steph, with the royal couple set to chortle and booze their way through a Gogglebox-style sketch. Entertainer: Prince Harry will also feature in the ITV show - albeit in puppet form . The Great British Fake Off: Stars Paul Hollywood and Mary Berry also feature in Newzoids . Speaking about the new show, Elaine Bedell, Director of Entertainment and Comedy for ITV, said: 'ITV has a rich history of playing popular satirical comedy in peaktime on its main channel, and it seemed a good time to revive it this year. 'We are pleased to be adding to our growing comedy portfolio with this funny and biting look at the world of politics and celebrity.' The show, which will be filmed by animation specialists Factory, will be voiced by a cast that includes impressionist Debra Stephenson and will be produced by Giles Pilbrow and Dominic Brigstocke who boast Have I Got News For You and Alan Partridge among their credits.","The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been turned into puppets .

21f0e99078680942ff19539244218ceaa4e39775,"Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League all season and on Saturday he demonstrated just how much he has grown as a player and how important he has been to Chelsea’s imminent title victory. He is now the player you look to in a crisis. He is the man who has been eking out wins when the team hasn’t been at its best. He did it last week at Queens Park Rangers, winning the ball from the goalkeeper’s kick and driving into the box to set up Cesc Fabregas, and he did it on Saturday with his finish. He’s dragging them over the line at the minute. You wondered when Jose Mourinho came in whether Hazard would be the kind of player who would work hard enough for him. And he would have taken the hint when he saw Juan Mata moved out that there would be no special favours from the manager for his creative players. Eden Hazard fires past David De Gea following a storming run from the Belgian star into the box . Hazard celebrates in front of the Stamford Bridge faithful following his 38th minute strike . The Chelsea forward's first-half strike proved crucial as the Blues eked out a 1-0 victory . He perhaps looked at that and responded. You will see in certain games against lesser teams he might have a licence not to track back — but not today, not against the best teams. Then he is required to do the requisite defensive work. And he does now. But the big change for him in the last 18 months has been in his finishing — and that was evident again on Saturday. He’s now on 17 goals for the season. He’s always been a player who could assist and create but now you look to him for goals. He is the danger man, he draws people to him and creates space for the rest of the team. He’s not in the top three players in the world at the moment but he’s creeping ever closer. What he will need to reach that level is for Chelsea to make a Champions League final and for him to be decisive. Hazard tries to guide a deflected shot into the United goal as Ander Herrera tries to snuff out the danger . He is improving every season, which is a good sign, and if he keeps doing that he has a chance of being that good. Chelsea will win the league now. I don’t think they’re at their best at the moment but managing a league campaign is not about playing well all the time. It’s about surviving the difficult periods — and Chelsea haven’t lost games when they’ve struggled in the same way that Manchester City or Manchester United did. Now they look a little tired as they get towards the finishing line and Mourinho would feel he has very strong squad of 13 and 14 but he will probably try to bring in people so he can give Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fabregas a couple of weeks rest at times to recuperate. As for United, for all their dominance in possession, they lacked enough clear-cut chances. In fact they needed something like the magic of Oscar’s back-heel and Hazard’s finish. Louis van Gaal will have been pleased that they controlled long periods of the game with their passing but they did lack that bit of punch. Wayne Rooney takes on Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas and Hazard at Stamford Bridge . With Wayne Rooney not being able to play at centre forward because of the injuries, it did neuter them somewhat. I thought he did well in midfield and proved that he can drop back into that position — his passing and play was excellent. But he’s been the thrust of the team in recent times. Maybe two years ago Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie could have provided that, but at the moment United need Rooney to give them that impetus in the really difficult games. When Sir Alex Ferguson left, you would have said it might take a couple of seasons to establish a new identity and build a new foundation. It’s been a bumpy ride and they wouldn’t have expected another change of manager, but at least, two years on, it looks as though they are now in that place. Jose Mourinho may look to give key players such as Fabregas (right) a rest in the coming weeks .","Eden Hazard has been the best player in the Premier League all season .

In April 2013, the Spanish manager declared that Terry could no longer play two games a week and that controversial decision, twinned with a persistent knee injury, meant the former England international made just 14 appearances for his beloved in the 2012-13 campaign.

As naturally-occurring pearls are rare, it's expected that Elliot's stash could fetch a princely sum. Eric Horton, who was serving Elliot at the time, said he couldn't believe what he saw happening. He swiftly grabbed a container to collect the pearls up from Eliot's dinner plate. Recalling the incident, he told WSMV News: 'It happens sometimes, every once in a while. 'However, this young lady continued to pull pearls out of her mouth, and the only thing we were missing was a string because she found 50 pearls in this one oyster.'

It has been suggested that a £10m bid could tempt Palace into selling the winger, who has excelled since Pardew arrived in January and launched the club up the table. But the Palace manager is adamant that the club's leading assets do not want to leave – and any players that do go will not be sold cheaply. That applies particularly to Bolasie, who scored a hat-trick in the demolition of Sunderland last week. Yannick Bolasie (centre) of Crystal Palace celebrates scoring against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light . Alan Pardew says Bolasie bidding will have to start at £20m for his star to leave Selhurst Park . Responding to a question about Joel Ward's contract extension, Pardew said: 'It was good news for us this week (with Ward). We wanted to send a statement that our players will be very, very difficult to take away. 'One, because they enjoy their football and two because we are going forward. Brede Hangeland said to me when he was at Fulham that he sensed that no one wanted to leave. (There was a report of a) £10m price on Bolasie. Blimey. 'It needs to be more than double that to get near him. We are in a great financial position. I am not getting carried away with where we are but we are doing very well in the Premier League.' That form includes four straight wins ahead of Tony Pulis's return to Selhurst Park on Saturday. Pardew believes Pulis should get a good reception at the club which he transformed last season before leaving days before this campaign started. Bolasie scored a hat-trick in Crystal Palace's demolition of Sunderland last week away from home . Pardew is demanding more than £20m for Bolasie to be taken away from Crystal Palace during the summer . But Pardew also indicated that his own job in lifting Palace this season had spared Pulis a potentially rocky return. He said: 'Tony achieved fantastic results here last season. For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.' Pardew has targeted a top-10 finish, saying: 'Top 10 is a realistic aim and then we want to build on that. The chairman has done a fantastic job. I will be banging his door down in the summer for some big signings.'

Prosecutors have said Robert Dellinger told investigators he was trying to kill himself in December 2013 when he drove his pickup truck across an Interstate 89 median and smashed into an SUV carrying 24-year-old Amanda Murphy, who was 8 months pregnant, and her fiance, 29-year-old Jason Timmons. Relatives of Murphy and Timmons tore into Dellinger during the first of the two-day sentencing hearing. Amanda Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, and Murphy's sister, Ashley Murphy, cry after speaking about the moment they learned of the accident that killed Murphy, her unborn child, and her fiancee, Jason Timmons, during Robert Dellinger's sentencing  on Wednesday . Defense attorney Lucy Karl comforts Robert Dellinger after testimony by the families of Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons. The former Fortune 500 executive has admitted causing a highway crash that killed them and their unborn fetus . 'I have been robbed and violated. I will never see or touch my child ever again,' Timmons' mother, Debbie Blanchard, said as she fought back tears. 'How could you be so heartless? You still have a family; you have taken mine from me', reports the Valley News of West Lebanon. Dellinger appeared to be deeply remorseful during the hearing, the newspaper reported. 'You have my deepest, most heartfelt apology, condolences and remorse for your loss. I am so sorry,' the 54-year-old Dellinger said through sobs. 'My guilt and remorse will be with me forever. I ask for your forgiveness, and I pray for your healing.' Dellinger, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was a senior vice president and chief financial officer at PPG Industries Inc. when he left in 2011 because of health problems. He also held high-level posts at Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co. Earlier he had  told the court he has 'never been suicidal.' Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013 .

During Wednesday's hearing, Dellinger's wife, Deborah, called him a man of 'ethics, integrity and friendship,' the Valley News reported. 'We are devastated by the deaths of your loved ones,' she said as her husband broke down at the defense table. 'We have been and continue to pray every day for your collective peace and comfort.' Dellinger reportedly broke down in tears at the defense table as his wife was speaking to the relatives of Murphy and Timmons. Defense lawyers have said Dellinger was suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of prescription medications for multiple sclerosis and depression. In asking for a shorter sentence, they also contend he was suffering from withdrawal of a sleeping aid. Robert Dellinger thanks his family and friends for their support in court on Wednesday. He told a judge that he wasn't suicidal at the time of the crash . Attorney Steven Gordon wrote in a sentencing brief they now know 'a medical event' was the main cause 'of this accident.' Dellinger has been jailed since his arrest in December. His lawyers want a sentence that would see him serve only about eight months in prison after being given credit for time already served. Investigators say Dellinger told them that on the day of the accident he 'had a disagreement with his wife and went to Vermont to drive around. He said he was very depressed and gloomy and wanted to have a car wreck and kill himself.' On Wednesday, Dellinger told the court: 'I have never been suicidal.' Assistant Attorney General Geoffrey Ward said in court that Dellinger's truck reached 101 mph in the seconds before the crash and was going 87 mph one second before he hit the SUV. His truck sheared off the top of the SUV. The medical examiner's report compared the injuries suffered by Murphy and Timmons to those of plane crash victims. Dellinger suffered cuts and bruises.

Discussing how different women's bodies react during pregnancy, Dr Venkat, Director at Harley Street Fertility Clinic, said: 'If a woman is healthy - physically and mentally - to start with and if she looks after herself well then she will look radiant. 'The hormones are elevated during pregnancy and women react differently to the hormones. Some women are particularly sensitive to elevated hormones and suffer with symptoms, whereas others sail through without any symptoms.' Dr Venkat added that a woman's height plays a role and the taller a woman is can help her carry herself with better posture than a shorter woman. When it comes to working out, she says, women generally don't need to worry about staying in shape during pregnancy. Citing walking and gentle stretching as the best exercises during pregnancy, she says women are going to be exhausted in the first couple of weeks after delivery and can start exercising after a fortnight, once a routine is established.

Bowling Green basketball coach Chris Jans has been fired after witnesses say he acted 'aggressively and inappropriately' at an off-campus bar . The university took action after footage emerged of the coach touching an unidentified woman's behind on March 21 . At least 50 people reportedly saw the coach out of control before being escorted out of the bar . The video, obtained by the Toldeo Blade, was recorded by the woman's parents. They then wrote a letter to Bowling Green athletics director Christopher Kingston detailing more of his inappropriate behavior. The correspondence, obtained by Deadspin, read: 'While we were enjoying each others company we noticed on several occasions Chris Jans making what seemed to be advances towards several women. 'On one occasion he grabbed a woman’s head and pushed it downwards toward his crotch. 'A Single guy, drunk, we can possibly overlook, but certainly inappropriate for a Head Coach representing my university and most definitely not a married man with two children.

April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and Autism Assistance Dogs are a little known but hugely beneficial form of 'animal therapy'. It turns out man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism who may otherwise struggle to talk, communicate, walk or socialise. An 'Autism Assistance Dog' is used to keep a child with autism safe and are an incredible tool to help them develop social skills and positive relationships. The term 'Autism Spectrum Disorders' (ASD) is an umbrella term that includes Autistic disorder; Asperger's and Atypical Autism. April 2 is Autism Awareness Day and people may be oblivious that man's best friend are actually 'kid's best friend', with pups changing the lives of many children with autism (stock picture) Children with autism often have difficulty with social interactions and their verbal and non-verbal communication skills may be badly affected. They can struggle to cope with change and unfamiliar environments and routines. 'The Autism Assistance Dog (AAD) Program is designed to improve the quality of life for both the child with autism and his or her family through three key areas: safety, independence and inclusion,' according to GuideDogs SA. Every child is unique meaning matching the right dog to their need's and their family is crucial. The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household. It has been reported by families participating in the Austism Assistance Dog Program that the companion can also foster positive interactions between siblings, encouraging play. The highly trained, specialised working dogs are licenced to accompany the child in essentially any location. 'An Austism Assistance Dog (AAD) has the same legal rights of access as a Guide or Hearing Dog. It is clearly identified by a coat which has securing points and a handle that the child can hold if appropriate or required,' according to GuideDogs SA. 'The purpose of the coat is to bring awareness to the special circumstances regarding the dog. This also increases the ease of access to public places by differentiating the status of an AAD from that of a pet.' The dog can provide companionship for the child, as well as social and emotional support for the parent to bring joy and 'brightness' to the household (stock picture) It can make family outings or even a quick trip to the shops possible where a child with autism may have struggled before. It can also give parents peace of mind as they know their child is being looked out for by a dog which has been specially trained to help their master avoid harm's way. The comfort of having their furry pooch by their side can offer a sense of stability for the child and be a calming presence on all members of the family. Children with autism 'have a high tendency to 'bolt' when they feel anxious or stressed. This is made even more alarming as they are often far less aware of danger and may not respond to direction. This can be a great challenge, requiring constant observance from their carer to ensure the child remains safe. 'On outings, the child's safety is enhanced by being connected to a coat on the dog's body, through a safety belt around the child's waist,' explained Guide Dogs SA. 'The parent has control of the dog through their own lead and will apply vocal commands to the dog. The child is encouraged to walk beside the dog but if they do choose to run off on their own, the dog is specially trained to quickly and calmly take control of the situation. 'The dog is trained to resist by sitting or lying down, acting as an ""anchor"",' GuideDogs SA explains. 'This gives the parent time to intervene and diffuse the situation.' However, the importance of this lesson is that, through the repetition, children's attempts to bolt are often reduced or completely eradicated. 'These dogs are a friend when you need one any hour of the day, every day of the year.

ffa0c5094595c9c9493ce9df92b802ba9b5e332d,"Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird and throwing another out of a window. The gang broke into an aviary and bundled 200 of the animals into sacks and containers around 3.30am on January 12. CCTV showed the men took the birds to a tower block in Walsall, West Midlands, and dumped them on the floor before kicking them and forcing them out of barely open windows. Four teenagers have been caught on camera kicking a rare bird, thought to be in the bag above, and throwing another out of a window in Walsall, West Midlands, on January 12 . The birds were also jammed into drawers, squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard. One resident reported that a dead bird was posted through his letterbox while others were dropped through windows. Three men and a youth have been convicted of their involvement and will be sentenced next month. Chad Worgan, from Walsall, admitted an offence of receiving stolen goods and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal on the basis that he kicked a pigeon. The 19-year-old knew the animals were in the bags and had a 'sick grin across his face' as he appearing to grab one of the perched birds and visibly squeeze it, the court heard. Thomas Knox, from Bloxwich, denied the same charges. A dog belonging to Knox, also 19, was let into the flat to terrorise the birds, it was revealed. Jake Higgs, 23, from Bloxwich, admitted receiving stolen goods but denied causing unnecessary suffering. A 16-year-old from Erdington, Birmingham, also attended but cannot be named for legal reasons. The birds were also jammed into drawers, shoved through barely open windows (above), squeezed to death and even chased by a dog, Walsall Magistrates Court heard . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. One of the men (above) can be seen with a grin on his face during the attack . All four were found guilty of the charges after a trial last week. Bob Thomas, chairman of the bench, said their actions amounted to 'joint enterprise'. He added: 'They arrive with a dog and are seen to be carrying a variety of bags and containers. These are emptied by them and both a large number of dead and live birds are seen. 'The CCTV shows all of them entering the property together and all playing some part in the birds' suffering. 'We are satisfied that they were all aware of the contents of the bags.' A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'The birds were stolen from an aviary in the Brownhills area in the early hours of January 12. 'They were then taken to Dolphin House where they were emptied onto the landing area of the block.' The birds were stolen from rare bird breeder Lee Williams who had built up his collection of rare jays, finches, doves, budgerigars, quails and pigeons over a number of years. In 2008, the dad-of-two considered giving up his passion after 270 animals worth £4,000 were stolen. Speaking at the time, his wife Michelle said: 'This has devastated him. His bird breeding plays a major part of his life.'","Gang bundled birds from aviary in Brownhills, West Midlands into sacks .

Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran’s agreement to reduce some of its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions would pave the way for Tehran to build an atomic bomb. In Iran yesterday, thousands danced in the streets to celebrate the landmark accord which could finally result in the easing of economic restrictions that have caused the price of essentials to soar and businesses to go bust. Danger: Benjamin Netanyahu said the deal will 'increase Iran's aggression and terror throughout the Middle-East' But Israel, which fears an Iranian nuclear attack, issued a series of dire warnings. Mr Netanyahu insisted that he and his Cabinet were united in ‘strongly opposing’ an agreement. ‘This deal would legitimise Iran’s nuclear programme, bolster Iran’s economy and increase Iran’s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond,’ the prime minister said. ‘It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.’ Other critics including Saudi Arabia and Republicans in the US say the deal leaves scope for Iran to cheat. Barack Obama, however, has hailed the agreement struck after tortuous negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland, as a ‘historic understanding’. There are still many details to be thrashed out before the deal is due to be signed on June 30, including the pace at which sanctions will be lifted and what happens if Iran is found to have breached the terms. But Mr Netanyahu told President Obama in a phone call yesterday that the existing framework ‘would threaten the survival of Israel’. According to tweets from his spokesman Mark Regev, Mr Netanyahu said: ‘The deal would not shut down a single nuclear facility in Iran. The deal would legitimise Iran’s illegal nuclear programme. ‘The alternative is standing firm and increasing the pressure on Iran until a better deal is achieved.’ Historic understanding: President Barack Obama hailed the nuclear agreement between Iran and U.S. while critics issued stark warnings . Mr Netanyahu is demanding that any final agreement must involve Iran’s recognition of Israel’s right to exist. President Hassan Rouhani has pledged that Iran will abide by its commitments in the nuclear agreement, which ends a standoff between Western powers and Iran lasting several years. Countries involved in the so-called P5+1 talks are the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany. Under the proposed terms, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges, the equipment used to enrich uranium into nuclear fuel, by two thirds, and can only enrich it enough to use for domestic power generation, not weapons. The deal also means that for the first time the Iranians will agree to have their nuclear plants inspected. And a major nuclear plant at Fordow will have to become a research lab, although one at Natanz can still carry out enrichment. Mr Obama said yesterday: ‘This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb. If Iran cheats, the world will know about it.’ He said that if the deal is finalised, ‘we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully’. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif insisted his country was not surrendering and stood to gain from the deal. After arriving home, he issued a statement saying: ‘We have serious goals in the negotiations and eventually, based on what we have achieved so far, we believe we can reach them.’","Lifting sanctions could pave the way for Iran to build atomic bomb .

Cro Crop lost to the Brazilian in 2007 when a first-round head kick brought a swift end to the bout at UFC 70. But he is confident he can avenge the defeat on home territory. Mirko Filipovic (right) faces Gabriel Gonzaga in Poland on Saturday, eight years after losing to the Brazilian . In 2007, Filipovic (right) was beaten by a first-round head kick and wants to avenge that defeat . Filipovic admitted revenge is a motivating factor ahead of the encounter against Gonzaga . ‘I want to beat all the opponents who have beaten me before,’ Cro Crop said. ‘But especially this fight because I lost to him and this time I feel better motivated and more prepared than I did last time. ‘He [Gonzaga] is a big guy. He is tough - he always goes for the victory and sometimes he is successful, sometimes he is less successful. But he definitely is a tough opponent for everyone. ‘I don’t want to think too far ahead - I am focusing on this fight and whatever is next, will happen. ‘I am in really great shape. My training is great - I keep the same schedule of training and I am prepared and ready for this fight. ‘I have been training with Stipe [Miocic] - he is a really great guy. We have been training really hard to prepare for both of our fights. He is just a great guy to train with and to be around. ‘All of the people I have lost against, I always want to fight again. UFC decided it would be Gonzaga and yes I wanted this rematch very much.’ Gonzaga, meanwhile, insists he does not view the fight as a rematch, given the eight-year wait. ‘I didn’t make any mistakes [in his last fight against Cro Cop] and he did make one, and I tried to capitalise on that,’ he said. ‘Eight years can change a lot. So much can change in that time so I do not consider this a rematch; I consider this a new fight. ‘I’ve got better in that time - my skill set has got better. ‘I’m going to try to avoid his high kick. But I will be ready wherever the fight goes. Gonzaga said he does not consider the fight with Filipovic a rematch because of the gap of eight years . Gonzaga believes that his skillset has got even better since the last time he took on Filipovic . ‘That’s the thing about the heavyweight division in the UFC, you know, one punch can change everything. ‘I believe people are never going to forget our first fight. But right now I just need to win this fight. ‘I always need to keep working towards the title shot. I am always trying to get there and I’m here to do that, to move closer to it.’","Mirko Filipovic aims to avenge 2007 first-round defeat to Gabriel Gonzaga .

The 39-year-old announced on Twitter that he will tee it up at TPC Sawgrass for the tournament often labelled as the 'fifth major'. 'Looking forward to going back to THE PLAYERS this year, hoping for a repeat of 2013,' he said. Woods' confirmed return will dampen fears over a wrist injury he appeared to suffer during the final round at Augusta when he hit a tree root. 'A bone kind of popped out and the joint kind of went out of place, but I put it back in,' he said. Woods, pictured with Rory McIlroy, found some form on his return to the US Masters .

Speculation over Woods' return had been circulating ever since the Masters when, following rounds of 73, 69, 68 and 73, he refused to confirm when he would be back in action. 'Not going to be for a while,' he said. 'I have a little time off, and go back to the drawing board, work on it again, and refine what I'm doing.

ffae5111cfbdd2a4f2ea3e51a48506e922b664f1,"Air crash investigators have recovered more body parts from the site where MH17 fell in eastern Ukraine after the Boeing 777 was shot out of the sky nine months ago. The Dutch-led team this week also found personal possessions including jewellery after the plane was downed by a suspected Russian-made BUK missile, killing all 298 passengers and crew on July 17, 2014. In all, 16 containers of fragments of the Malaysia Airlines plane were filled so far this week. Dutch and Malaysian investigators and local authorities examine debris at the MH17 plane crash site . Chilling: MailOnline's photographer spotted the burned and torn passport of loving wife and mother Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, one of the 298 slaughtered when MH17 was downed over Ukraine on July 17, 2014. Her family in Kuala Lumpur has given MailOnline permission to publish the picture . The investigators searched for body parts and debris at a location that was previously considered unsafe . The finds came several days after MailOnline revealed how possibly key evidence and personal possessions were left lying in fields so long after a crash which shocked the world. MailOnline also found a charred passport of a Malaysian mother killed in the horror. Relatives of Mabel Anthonysamy Soosai, 45, whose husband and son were also killed, called for urgent action to clear the site, return items to bereaved families and bring those responsible for the carnage to justice. 'It broke my heart to see the picture, her passport still in the debris of the plane,' said her brother Clement, 47, in Kuala Lumpur. 'But thank you so much for finding it and telling us about it.' Also spotted at the site by MailOnline were a bracelet made of beads, a pair of sunglasses, ripped clothing and random pages from guidebooks in a reminder that many of the murdered passengers were heading to Kuala Lumpur on holiday. Investigators have renewed their search for body parts and debris in eastern Ukraine this week . A vehicle carries away debris from the site of the plane crash near the village of Grabove, in self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic . Many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - were visible among MH17's burned remains. Investigators say they were prevented from working properly in the locations where MH17 hit the ground due to fierce fighting between pro-Moscow rebels and Ukrainian military forces. The new finds of human remains were collected this week by the Dutch - working with Malaysian, Australian and Ukrainian colleagues - at a site previously inaccessible to the investigators, it was revealed. Head of the Dutch recovery mission Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg said: 'More remains have been found in both parts of the so-called ""burn sites.""' Jean Fransman, spokesman for the Dutch Department of Justice, added: 'The mission was again able to recover human remains and personal effects at two sites.' A statement said that 'personal effects were given to the members of the mission by the local population - it was jewellery'. An investigator wheels away parts of debris from the site of the plane crash in eastern Ukraine . Grim: Alongside Mabel's passport, many small parts from the plane - such as controllers for the in-flight entertainment systems - are visible among MH17's charred detritus . Haunting: Personal belongings of victims are still littered around the field - and possibly crucial evidence -because the crash scene hasn't been cleared nine months after the Malaysian Airways flight came down . A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash . The latest search operation had resumed yesterday after being halted for winter, and centred around the Petropavlivka, some 10 kilometres (6.25 miles) west of Grabove and Granovo where most of the debris fell. A local official had told MailOnline how the 'smell of death' hung over the area nine months after the crash. Officials of the rebel Donetsk People's Republic were also at the site during the search which will last several weeks subject to a ceasefire holding in the region. 'A group of Dutch and Malaysian experts is working in the DPR,' said Aleksey Kostrubitskiy, local emergencies minister. 'Today 10 per cent of the area - two places where fragments had fallen and there was fire - was worked over. 'Sixteen containers of fragments have been loaded. 'Units of the [DPR] emergencies ministry will go there every day and 10 staffers of the emergencies ministry will be involved.' The Dutch-led team was forced to leave the crash site in August amid shooting close to the crash site. Souvenir: A shot glass bought as a reminder of what should have been a jovial trip lies on the ground . A sign indicating the entrance to the site in eastern Ukraine is forbidden is displayed as Dutch and Malaysian investigators search for debris . The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands . A week long recovery operation in November was delayed by fighting between separatists and Ukrainian troops. Representatives of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have also faced acute problems accessing the crash site to secure key evidence. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site. The debris collected by the investigators will be initially sent to Kharkiv in Ukraine, before being taken to the The Netherlands. Forensic experts in the Dutch city of Hilversum have identified bodies of 296 victims of the crash. Two victims - both from the Netherlands - remain unidentified. The probe team is due to issue its report into the crash later this year. After a ceasefire was called in February, Dutch experts returned the following month, yet still much debris remains at the site . A preliminary report in September, which apportioned no blame, said the plane 'broke up in the air probably as the result of structural damage caused by a large number of high-energy objects that penetrated the aircraft from outside'. Kiev and the West have claimed that separatists or Russian forces, using a BUK surface-to-air missile supplied by Moscow, were responsible for the shooting down of MH17. The Kremlin strongly refutes the charge, and senior Russian sources have claimed that a Ukrainian warplane blasted MH17 out of the sky. 'Now that we are at an advanced stage of the repatriation mission, the (criminal) investigation and prosecution will occupy a more central place,' said Dutch Justice Minister Ard van der Steur this week. Leaks suggest that investigators suspect regular troops rather than rebels were involved in the shooting of a BUK missile, and that these soldiers 'might have changed their identities or even been executed by Russian secret service in order to hide everything'. Moscow also denies it has ever had troops in eastern Ukraine, a claim the West finds implausible. Investigators examine the crash site of the MH17 plane, next to a sign reading 'no entrance' Putin's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accuses the Western media of ignoring sightings by locals of a Ukrainian military aircraft in the vicinity of the stricken flight. Dutch broadcaster RTL reported that shrapnel collected from the crash site and tested by independent international forensic experts, including defence analysts IHS Jane's in London, say it matched the explosive charge of a ground-to-air BUK. Alleged intercepted phone calls between rebels seem to back up the version that the plane was downed by a BUK crew using equipment smuggled in and out from Russia. If this could be proven, it would blow apart the Russian denial of involvement in eastern Ukraine quite apart from its assistance that it had nothing to do with the downing of MH17. But as one source close to investigators said: 'It looks like key evidence and witnesses, namely the BUK missile and its crew, have been hidden deep inside Russia which is in denial over this whole episode. 'Probably the inquiry report will blame the attack on a BUK missile, but seeing anyone face justice over this crash is quite another matter.' The dead from MH17 comprised 192 Dutch citizens (one also had U.S. citizenship), 44 Malaysians, including the 15 crew members, 27 Australians, 12 Indonesians, ten Britons (one also had South African citizenship), four Germans, four Belgians, three Filipinos, one Canadian and one New Zealander.","Investigators have found more body parts from where MH17 fell in Ukraine .

And the Frenchman's reward for their good form was another Manager of the Month accolade to sit on his mantelpiece. Wenger has quite a few of the gongs now - 14 to be exact - but he has quite a long way to run until he matches the 27 monthly prizes of Sir Alex Ferguson.

The legendary Manchester United manager was the inaugural winner of the Manager of the Month award when it was introduced in August 1993, at the start of the Premier League's second season. With United winning no fewer than 12 Premier League titles during that time, it comes as little surprise to see the Scot top of the list. In the 1999-2000 campaign, he won it in August, March and April as United romped to the title by 18 points and exerted a similar dominance in 2006-2007, claiming the prize in August, October and February. The last of Ferguson's 27 awards came in October 2012, not long before he announced his retirement. A Manchester United double as Alex Ferguson and Eric Cantona celebrate their awards in 1996 . Ferguson won 27 monthly prizes in all, including this one for February 1997 . Ferguson and Wayne Rooney were celebrating in February 2005 as they claimed the monthly prizes . Wenger first got his hands on the award in March 1998 and also won it the following month as Arsenal claimed the Double of Premier League and FA Cup in his first full campaign. Before this month's win, Wenger had last been recognised in September 2013 as his team made a positive start in a campaign that would ultimately see them finish fourth. He may have struggled to fill Ferguson's shoes at Old Trafford, but David Moyes won this accolade 10 times when in charge of Everton. Harry Redknapp and Martin O'Neill have the monthly award listed eight times on their CVs, while Bobby Robson, Rafa Benitez and Sam Allardyce both have six. Jose Mourinho may have led Chelsea to two Premier League titles but his tally of three is not as many as the four won by Joe Kinnear during his days as Wimbledon manager. 27 - Manchester United . 14 - Arsenal, Liverpool . 13 - Newcastle United . 12 - Everton . 11 - Chelsea . 9 - Manchester City, Southampton . 8 - Tottenham Hotspur . 7 - Aston Villa, Bolton Wanderers . 6 - Blackburn Rovers . 5 - Leeds United, West Ham United . 4 - Leicester City, Wimbledon . 3 - Charlton Athletic, Coventry City, Middlesbrough, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, Reading, Sheffield Wednesday, Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion, Wigan Athletic . 2 - Fulham, Swansea City . 1 - Birmingham City, Crystal Palace, Derby County, Hull City, Ipswich Town, Norwich City, Oldham Athletic, Queens Park Rangers .

Remarkably, Kinnear was manager of the month in September 1993, March 1994 and then April 1994 as his team finished sixth before a final award in Septmber 1996. Given Ferguson's dominance, it comes as little surprise that Manchester United come out on top in the clubs list. Wenger's win this month means Arsenal now have 14 overall, the same as Liverpool. Newcastle United aren't far behind with 13, followed by Everton on 12 and Chelsea on 11. English managers dominate the list looking back, with 75 managers from this country having won the prize.

4f055df190abf75e44c9f48126bdb81cfd921980,"Joe Anderson, 56, the Mayor of Liverpool, claimed £4,500 per year from Chesterfield High School, Merseyside, despite doing nothing for pupils . A Labour mayor who campaigned against austerity while being paid an £80,000 salary took  £4,500 per year from a school where he previously worked, despite doing nothing for pupils. Joe Anderson, 56, the Mayor of Liverpool, attempted to justify the payments by saying he provided the school with 'kudos' for being linked to him. And when Chesterfield High School in Crosby, Merseyside, stopped the payments in 2011, he attempted to sue them, claiming discrimination because of his 'philosophical belief' in public service. The details of the case, published in The Times, came after Mr Anderson rejected an employment tribunal ruling against him and took his case to appeal, which was also rejected. In the most recent case, Judge Daniel Serota ruled that outsiders would consider the payments a 'misapplication of public monies ' and that the school was right to stop them. He added that he had repeatedly asked Mr Anderson's lawyers to state what benefits the school got in return for their cash. He said: 'The only answer that I received was that it gave 'kudos' to the school.' Mr Anderson had been a senior learning mentor at the school from 2001, when he was already a Liverpool councillor. He eventually rose through the ranks to become full-time leader of the council in 2010, effectively stopping his role as a mentor, but he continued taking payments from his former employer. When the school became an academy in 2011, and therefore had greater freedom over its finances, it ceased paying Mr Anderson, leading to his discrimination claim. Mr Anderson, who is paid an £80,000 salary, tried to sue the school (pictured) for discrimination after it stopped the payments, saying he was being punished for a 'philosophical belief' in public service .

It also ruled that, while Mr Anderson's belief in public service is a protected status, he had not been discriminated against.","Joe Anderson, 56, earns £80,000 in full-time job as the Mayor of Liverpool .

8cb5e2d2d9ccf8334d922359adc7340de9a29b7c,"Everton manager Roberto Martinez insists he is not concerned that Romelu Lukaku has joined forces with high-powered agent Mino Raiola ahead of a potential summer of transfer speculation surrounding the striker. Raiola, steeped in Italian and Dutch football, is one of the most influential agents in the game, with Paris Saint-Germain striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba and Liverpool’s Mario Balotelli among his high-profile clients. The Italian middleman has been involved in transfer deals worth over £400million and Lukaku’s decision to sever his links with Christophe Henrotay, who oversaw his Everton club record £28m move from Chelsea last summer, adds a possible new dimension to his career. Romelu Lukaku (left) poses alongside his new agent Mino Raiola in an Instagram picture . The appointment of Raiola as agent fuels speculation Lukaku (left) could be set for a move away from Everton . Roberto Martinez, the Everton manager, is unconcerned by Lukaku joining Raiola . The Belgium striker, 21, has scored only eight times in the Premier League so far this season compared with 15 last term. But he has netted 18 in total, including eight in the Europa League which spearheaded Everton’s run to the last 16. With Everton 13th in the Barclays Premier League there will be no European adventure next season but Martinez, who persuaded Lukaku to turn a season-long loan into a permanent five-year deal last summer, is adamant that the player’s switch of agents has not set the alarm bells ringing. Martinez said: ‘He has changed his agent, yes, but we are not concerned, no. Rom is entitled to do that. ‘Everyone speaks about the colourful character that Mino Raiola is but he has a lot of players who are very much people who are happy to stay at one club. ‘I dealt with Mino Raiola at Wigan and not many people know that he had Danny de Ridder or Vladimir Weiss, players who have been happy to stay at a club. I don’t think there is anything to read into that.’ Martinez does not expect a summer of upheaval at Goodison Park, despite the team’s disappointing campaign. Veteran defender Sylvain Distin, 37, who has not featured in the league since late December, will leave at the end of his contract but, according to Martinez, fellow centre back Antolin Alcaraz still has a chance to earn a new deal during the closing weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the manager insists 21-year-old midfielder Ross Barkley can build on his performances from the bench for England against Lithuania and Italy to finish an indifferent season on a high. ‘He will benefit from the experiences of this difficult season,’ added Martinez, whose side entertain Southampton on Saturday. Raiola has engineered big money moves for players such as Mario Balotelli at Liverpool . Martinez believes that Ross Barkley (left) will benefit from the difficult season that he has endured . ‘This is his second full season in an important role in the squad. ‘He enjoys that responsibility and taking responsibility in big games. ‘He has an incredible technical ability and, with the physicality he has, you don’t see many players in world football with those capabilities. ‘We know who Ross is and how important he is for the future of Everton.’","Roberto Martinez unconcerned by Romelu Lukaku's link with Mino Raiola .

61faa98dffc07dc46bdaa4353c094e2e5bb65b39,"Just over a decade ago Gianfranco Zola was voted the greatest Chelsea player of all time in a poll of the club's supporters. This may seem a little premature, but as Eden Hazard prepares for to make his 100th Barclays Premier League appearance for Chelsea at QPR on Sunday, the little magician could have a rival in years to come. Hazard is some player, one of the elite in English football with those dazzling runs and the sparkling feet that can open up the best defences in the league. Eden Hazard has developed into one of the world's best players after flourishing at Chelsea . Hazard has proven himself as a goalscorer and a creator of chances during his time with Chelsea . Hazard celebrates scoring against Hull earlier this season as Chelsea march towards the Premier League title . This season he has been imperious, full of movement and flexibility as Chelsea close in on a double of Capital One Cup and Premier League in Jose Mourinho's second season back at Stamford Bridge. After Chelsea's 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain in February at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho demanded more protection from referees for Hazard. Chelsea's dancing winger is a marked man. The PFA young player of the year had been fouled nine times, with Laurent Blanc's team taking it in turns to nobble the Chelsea No 10 in the first leg of their Champions League second round tie. He has scored some special goals, 17 so far with another nine assists, as Mourinho's team close in on a fourth Premier League title in the Abramovich era. On Sunday, April 26 the PFA players' player of the year award could be his, joining a list of winners that includes Luis Suarez, Gareth Bale, Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo, Thierry Henry and his Chelsea team-mate John Terry in recent times. He has grown to love English football, adapting to the demands of the Premier League and the numerous managers he has already played for since his move from Lille in 2012. Roberto Di Matteo was still Chelsea's manager when Hazard tweeted that he was joining 'this season's Champions League winner' ahead of his £32million move from France. He made an impressive start in the Premier League, assisting the opening goal for Chelsea in the 2-0 victory at Wigan and winning the penalty for Frank Lampard to convert at the DW Stadium. Hazard joined Chelsea from Lille for £32million in 2012 after the Blues beat a host to clubs to his signature . Hazard was involved in a controversial incident at Swansea when he kicked the ball as it lay under the ball boy . Hazard was sent off after the ball-boy incident as Chelsea were beaten in the Capital One Cup semi-final . Hazard, his wife Natasha and their kids enjoy some off time at Disneyland Paris . Di Matteo loved him as a player and he went through a notable dip in form when the European Cup-winning coach was fired after the 4-1 defeat against Juventus in the Champions League. A few months later he was sent off when he infamously wrestled with a ball-boy during Chelsea's Capital One Cup semi-final defeat against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium. He finished the season with a Europa League medal after Chelsea's victory over Benfica the Amsterdam ArenA, but it is the arrival of Mourinho that has transformed his game. Last season there was a period of frustration among Chelsea's first team players because they shared the view of the coach that they had signed a world class talent. Despite his ability he was often one of the first to leave after training, heading home to his family - wife Natasha and their two young children, after a quick shower and lunch with his team-mates. Slowly he has bought into dressing room culture. There is a ruthless streak about him these days and Mourinho, to his credit, drew it out of him after meeting Hazard's father, along with his lawyer, after Belgium's disappointing World Cup in Brazil. Hazard has grown in stature since he was handed Juan Mata's old No 10 shirt, requesting the jersey after the winger left for Manchester United in January 2014. The No 10 shirt is also the number of his hero Zinedine Zidane, the player a young Hazard idolised when he was making his way through Belgian football before his move to Lille. In recent times he has been encouraged to drift across the front three positions, interchanging with Oscar (in the centre) and Willian (on the right) when it takes his fancy. Hazard helped Chelsea win the Europa League under Rafa Benitez when they beat Benfica in the final . Hazard, pictured alongside Luis Suarez, was named the PFA Young Player of the Year last season . Hazard added a second trophy to his Chelsea collection this season when the Blues won the Capital One Cup . Jose Mourinho transformed Hazard's game after he suffered a dip following the departure of Roberto Di Matteo . Mourinho poses with Hazard after he was named Chelsea's Player of the Year last season . He is the focal point of Chelsea's attack, a willing outlet with a first touch that you can melt when he takes it on the instep of his right boot. He has been scoring goals again, adding to his tally this season in recent weeks with strikes for club and country as the season hurtles towards the finish line. At 24 he is maturing nicely, a humble man who impressed Chelsea's hierarchy during the complex negotiations over a new contract towards the end of last year. He has never been responsible for the glut of stories linking him with a move back to France to play for Paris Saint-Germain and he consistently told the club that he was willing to remain at Stamford Bridge. Hazard's contract talks were reminiscent of Gary Neville at Manchester United, leaving it with the club to determine the terms on his new five-year contract. Chelsea settled on £200,000 a week. To those who know him, he speaks of trophies and a hunger to be remembered as a player who contributed to one of the most successful periods in Chelsea's history. Given time, he could even be remembered as the very best. Hazard recently signed a bumper new five-year deal at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week . In Hazard, Gianfranco Zola may soon have a rival as Chelsea's greatest ever player .","Eden Hazard will make his 100th league appearance for Chelsea on Sunday .

The Croatian suffered a cut to the top of the nose from an elbow by Sergio Ramos and fellow Real defender Dani Carvajal punched him in the stomach, an incident unseen by the referee, during the clash at the Calderon that ended 0-0.

'We now have another training session where we expect him to be okay and I will base my plan, which I have fairly clearly in mind, around that.' Mandzukic is favourite, ahead of Fernando Torres, to play in attack alongside Antoine Griezmann who took his time to settle in at Atletico but is now in a rich vein of form. 'He has developed a lot since he arrived and the goals that he has scored in La Liga show that,' said Simeone. France international Griezmann hit both goals against Deportivo and has 20 in La Liga.

bb0d2ac342a86544b38da9fd31bfcb560c722f0a,"David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work after Britain was singled out as one of the few 'bright spots' in the global economy. The Prime Minister will vow to encourage more job creation by extending national insurance breaks, worth at least £2,000 a year to smaller firms taking on new staff, for a further five years. Saying he is 'really angry' at Labour's claim that the Conservatives are 'the party for the few, not the many', Mr Cameron will hail the 'jobs miracle' that has seen 1,000 new jobs created every day. David Cameron will today claim that Labour's economic policies risk putting a million people out of work . Contrasting that with Labour's record, he will claim Ed Miliband's economic policies could see 'a million more people joining the dole queues'. Last night, in a boost for George Osborne, the head of the International Monetary Fund picked out the UK recovery as exemplary. Christine Lagarde said the world was suffering from a 'moderate and uneven' return to growth which was 'simply not good enough'. But, in an endorsement of the Government's economic record, she cited the United States and the United Kingdom as countries where the outlook is positive. The comments completed an extraordinary volte-face by the IMF on the Coalition's handling of the economy. Just two years ago, it warned that Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity – only to see the economic recovery take off. Britain was the best performing major economy in the developed world last year, with growth of 2.8 per cent. Figures published by the fund also show it has overtaken socialist-run France to become the second most powerful economy in Europe behind Germany. However, the IMF predicted Britain would still be running a deficit at the end of the decade – despite Tory efforts to balance the books. Cameron will say if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of last Labour government there will be a risk to jobs . Mr Cameron, who dismissed the projections, will today launch a Conservative 'jobs manifesto' setting out plans to bring about 'full employment' – meaning everyone who wants a job has one. 'We are living through a jobs miracle – brought to you by a Conservative government that has backed business, reformed welfare and rewarded work,' he will say. Claiming Mr Miliband represents a threat to jobs, he will add: 'You know what makes me really angry? It's when our opponents still go on about 'you Tories – the party for the few and not the many…' Excuse me? 'This is the party that's taken three million of the lowest-paid workers out of income tax altogether; that's cut the taxes of 26million working people; that's seen 1,000 jobs created every day – jobs that are giving families security, putting food on tables, helping people out of poverty. 'Under the last five years of Labour, unemployment went up by 600 people a day. 'So if Ed Miliband repeated the economic mistakes of the last Labour government – that he was a part of – he risks a million more people joining the dole queues.' The jobs manifesto will include a guarantee to maintain the so-called 'employment allowance' until 2020, meaning a third of employers will continue to pay no jobs tax for another five years. The tax break, which helps smaller businesses take on new workers by freeing businesses from at least the first £2,000 of employers' national insurance, has already been taken up by 856,000 firms. David Cameron pictured on a metal platform yesterday (left) and John Major on his soap box in 1992 (right) One of the most abiding images from the 1992 General Election campaign was the moment John Major got on his soap box. And yesterday David Cameron did the same... but gave it a 21st century twist by taking to a folding metal platform. During a campaign stop in Leeds, the Prime Minister raised himself above the closely packed crowd to engage in a question and answer session with employees at the O2 office in Morley and Outwood – the marginal constituency of shadow chancellor Ed Balls. Major climbed onto an old fashioned soap box in Cheltenham to persuade Conservatives to come out and vote in 1992, just ten days before the election. He went on to win the fourth consecutive victory for the Tories – and their last outright UK majority.","David Cameron will launch 'job manifesto' with plans for 'full employment'

05b2de3be942a2627353d8a946bca4dda2b94b9a,"Chelsea took a commanding 3-1 lead back to west London after a strong showing in Manchester to see off City's young side. Dominic Solanke scored late on to put a gloss on the scoreline after a Tammy Abraham double had seen Chelsea take a first half lead. Sportsmail was at the Academy Stadium to see how the youngsters got on... Tammy Abraham smashes Chelsea into the lead with a fierce drive into the top corner . Manchester City (4-2-3-1) Kjetil Haug: Norwegian international has been on the bench for long periods but got the nod and looked shaky under the high ball. That said, powerless to stop Abraham's volleys and Soalnke's killer. 6.5 . Pablo Maffeo: Barcelona-born former Espanyol youngster is not the tallest and at times struggled with Chelsea's diagonals early on but grew into the game and could have levelled. 6.5 . Tosin Adarabioyo: Manchester lad and England youth international, City's captain was a commanding presence at the heart of defence. Has the movement of Yaya Toure but put a big shift in. 7 . Christian Haug goes up for the ball under pressure from Chelsea forwards during the Youth Cup final . Cameron Humphreys-Grant: Has captained England and, like Adarabioyo had his hands full against a vibrant Chelsea attack but stood up to the test well. 6.5 . Jose Angelino Tasende: Spanish left-back is not the tallest and was not able to drive forward as much as he would have liked against strong opposition. 6 . Kean Bryan: Box-to-box midfielder from Beswick, yards away from the Etihad Stadium, pulled up injured after 36 minutes but battled back bravely but missed a glorious chance to tie things up. 6.5 . Manchester City midfielder Kean Bryan tracks the run of Dominic Solanke as City looked to stem the tide . Aaron Nemane: Moved to Manchester from France as a toddler, the wide man who scored twice in the first leg of the Semi Final did outwitted Dasilva with a delightful tap and go but could not find the final, killer ball. Blasted wide when should have levelled. 6.5 . Bersant Celina: Kosovan international Celina struggled to fill in for injured star Thierry Ambrose, seeing one shot from the edge of the area easily held by Collins. 6 . Manu Garcia: Joined City from Sporting Gijon and the mini David Silva showed some neat touches on the rare occasions he found space. Was largely ineffective and should have done better when teed up by Barker late on. Yanked on 85 minuted. 6 . Manuel Garcia gets a shot away, but it was blocked by Jake Clarke-Salter . Isaac Buckley-Ricketts: Pacy Mancunian centre forward produced measured finish to bring City level but was marshalled well for the majority of the evening. 7 . Brandon Barker: City's star man, the two-footed local lad is tipped for big things at the Etihad but was perhaps guilty of trying to do too much at times here. Did create a fine chance for Garcia with a trademark surge and almost levelled late on. 7.5 . City's players celebrate after Isaac Buckley (left) had levelled the game in the first half . Chelsea (4-2-3-1) Bradley Collins: The Southampton-born stopper could do little about City's opener and distributed the ball well. 6.5 . Fikayo Tomori: Canadian born but eligible for England combined well with Clarke-Salter to nullify City's threat in a commanding-looking partnership. 7 . Ola Aina: England Under-19 right-back found space time and time again down the right. Quick, strong and often influential. 7 . Jake Clarke-Salter: England Under 18s international often too strong for Buckley-Ricketts and, on the evidence of this sterling performance, is one to watch. 7 . Jay Dasilva: Under-21 regular is still 16. Fortunate to escape at least a caution with a from-behind challenge in the first half but was solid at the back and lively going forward, whipping in a number of decent crosses. 7 . Ruben Sammut: Scottish youth international covered his back four expertly and kickstarted a number of breaks as City pressed. 6.5 . Ruben Sammut plays the ball out in an excellent performance protecting the back four . Tammy Abraham: Two volleys for his 35th and 36th strikes of the season. Big, bold and often brilliant, Chelsea will be hoping the injury that saw him substituted on 67 minutes is not serious. 8 . Charlie Colkett: Put in a captain's shift in the centre of the park as the visitors won the midfield battle. Is tipped for big things and showed just why. 7.5 . Abraham makes it 2-1 at the Academy Stadium with an acrobatic finish past Christian Haug . Dominic Solanke: Scored for England in the European Under-17 Championship Final and put in a powerful shift here, teaming up well with Abraham before effectively killing the tie with a neat third. 7.5 . Charly Musonda: The Belgian playmaker, the only overseas man in the starting XI, was quiet by his standards and drilled a decent chance tamely wide. Departed late on. 6 . Isaiah Brown: Said to be interesting Jose Mourinho but will not want to dwell on his big moment early on when he blasted over bar when unmarked on the edge of the box. Miss aside, was a constant menace. Substitutes: . Kasey Palmer (Abraham, 67, 6): On for Abraham and showed explosive pace straight away but was let down by a hurried attempt at a finish which flew over the bar.

b28a6817812aa75abeb9abbf6f4050f4d7f85314,"Preconceptions, I find, can be really unhelpful, so before travelling to The Datai, a luxury hotel in Malaysia, I decided not to find out anything about it. I preferred instead to be delighted - or otherwise - on arrival. I was travelling with my old mucker Doon Mackichan (from Smack The Pony, Plebs, The Day Today). Our paths first crossed almost 30 years ago as rookies on the comedy circuit, but since then we have, by chance, both acquired part-time homes in the same seaside town. It is Doon who has taught me to stride like a warrior into the freezing Channel. Luxury personified: The Datai Hotel has all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City, says Maria McErlane . Setting off for the Far East, there was something of the Hinge and Bracket about us, blithering away in actressy tones, trying to charm the Air Malaysia crew into granting us a cheeky upgrade. (Which failed.) But that was soon forgotten and the joy of leaving Britain behind in cold mid-December was fully realised when we disembarked into the densely tropical humidity of Langkawi. After a 30-minute taxi ride through darkness and impenetrable forests, The Datai appeared with all the colour and wonder of the Emerald City. Full-size carved horses illuminated by antique torches guarded the entrance, as beautiful silk sari-clad Malaysian staff welcomed us with cocktails. In the background, the ubiquitous lobby pianist/singer warbled away to I Just Called To Say I Love You. A minor note of tedium. Langkawi is an archipelago of 104 islands in the Andaman Sea, 20 miles off the coast of Malaysia. In 2007 it was given World Geopark status by Unesco. The Datai Hotel and Resort is in the north west of the island. Maria McErlane (left) with painter Doon Mackichan at The Datai hotel in Malaysia . This paradise in the middle of a ten million-year-old rainforest was created in 1990. Designed by Australian architect Kerry Hill around Datai Bay - a white sandy crescent beach voted one of the ten most beautiful in the world, with its magnificent backdrop of jungle and mountains - the resort took three years to complete. To minimise its impact on the jungle, Hill limited the size of the main building and added 40 villas over the extensive grounds, along with restaurants and a spa alongside a creek. He sourced wood, marble and stone from across the island and mainland Malaysia to create Mayan walls, Malay roofs and Japanese screens. The result sees soft, subtle colours creating an atmosphere throughout of calm tranquillity, offset by genuine animal sounds that could well come from a Now That's What I Call Jungle Noises Volume 1. Leaving the main building behind, we were taken by golf buggy down the 'yellow brick roads' through the enchanted forest, across bridges, and past waterfalls and freshwater streams to our elegant beach villa where we were met by our butlers. Keen to revive our weary bones, Doon asked if it was safe to swim. 'No,' came the answer. 'Why not?' she questioned, expecting to be told of danger. 'Because it is dark,' the butler replied with a smile. Spot of swimming anyone? The Andaman Ocean turns out to be the perfect choice for a dip at any time . Clearly he doesn't know Doon. She has been part of a team swimming the Channel in extreme conditions and also took part in the World Ice Swimming Championships in Finland ('you can feel your body slowing down as hypothermia begins to set in', she boasts). She is made of stern stuff. Despite it being close to midnight, we ran down to the beach, disrobing and squealing, before plunging into the silky-smooth Andaman sea. Phosphorescence streamed through the water, illuminating our limbs as we swam towards the lights of Thailand on the horizon. It was a magical beginning to our holiday. Back at our opulent Balinese-meets-New England villa, we were quite overcome by the super-sized beds, hot outdoor showers, plunge pool, Bose sound system, zillionthread soft cotton sheets, quietly whirring wooden fans, high-tech lighting (we longed for a light switch) and blackout blinds. Buggies can be summoned at a moment's notice, but the next morning we preferred a stroll on the beach, through the jungle, along wooden walkways and up the 139 Mayan temple-inspired steps to breakfast. Clutching our nature books, we were serenaded by squawking macaques and doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys swinging from Tarzan vines through the trees. First class display: The pair were serenaded by doe-eyed dusky leaf monkeys in the trees . Brahminy kites and green imperial pigeons flew overhead, and we both leapt back in horror when a three foot long monitor lizard slithered across the path into the undergrowth. It really was a first-class display from the jungle inhabitants. After breakfast on the terrace, we took mountain bikes and cycled to the resort's golf course. Golf is not really my thing, but if you know your sand wedge from your nine iron, this course is fantastic - everything is groomed to within an inch of a Stepford wife. In fact, the Els Club Teluk Datai has been voted the best 'new' golf course in the world. Having ignored the warning to keep all doors and windows closed, Doon arrived back at the villa to find a scene of devastation: a monkey burglary. Every drawer had been wrenched open, newspapers shredded, jars unscrewed, suitcase contents scattered and chocolates eaten - tiny slivers of silver paper being the only remains of a Toblerone. Doon had painted a watercolour earlier that morning which the monkeys had 'relieved' themselves on. We didn't need a forensics team to identify our uninvited guests as chocolatey paw prints were everywhere. I was secretly rather thrilled with their ingenuity. After such excitement, a sea dip was needed before several Beach Club cocktails and much embellished recounting of 'Monkeygate'. The four restaurants at The Datai are overseen by executive chef Richard Millar. There's the Beach Club specialising in Mediterranean and international cuisine; The Gulai House, tucked into the forest and offering intensely flavoursome Malay and Indian offerings; the Dining Room in the main building; and The Pavilion, a restaurant on 100ft-high balau stilts erected with the help of elephants (yes, really). Doon remarked that it resembled a 'birds' nest in the sky', albeit one that serves traditional Thai cuisine. Such was our commitment to sampling all the restaurants, we both managed to gain half a stone in a week. Maria heads to the beach after a lazy breakfast . The most pleasing element of our beach view was the lack of visiting boats, save for the Naga Pelangi (Rainbow Dragon), a traditional wooden Malaysian junk schooner hand-built in the boatyards of Duyung island on the east coast of Malaysia. We were invited aboard for a trip to the Geopark to watch brown eagles feed and, in Doon's case, to find dolphins. Her chosen method to summon these creatures was to serenade them in full operatic mode with songs from Carmen - an impressive but futile exercise as they stayed away. If the many activities at The Datai become too much, gentler pursuits are on offer, such as an 8am nature walk that teaches participants the ways of the forest. For me, however, it was a bit early for concentration, so I excused myself and enjoyed a lazy breakfast. Later, in the bathroom, a bean bagsized frog fell from the air-con vent on to my head before hopping on to the cistern, blinking into the daylight: a reminder, were one needed, of the Herculean task it must be preventing the jungle from taking back its land. During our stay, in a futile attempt to counter the calorific intake, we swam morning, noon and night. One longer excursion across the tranquil Datai Bay with flippers and snorkels resulted in us being spiked by sea urchins and stung by jellyfish. Neither incident was a huge deal, but the Datai nurses were on hand within moments of us returning to land, and even took time to check on us the following day. Before leaving Datai, we squeezed in a trip to the spa, which is open to the jungle. I could see the creek below and hear the monkeys gossiping. The ubiquitous plinky-plonky spa musak was quickly redundant when the heavens open and the full rainforest orchestra began its symphony in earnest. During my 90-minute treatment - a Ramuan massage - I'm not sure I have ever been, nor will ever be again, in such a state of zen relaxation. The Datai was truly special. Mystical, spiritual, romantic, luxurious, life-affirming... and fattening. We can't wait to go back.

0c15f4bb435ecef83ae88a19ba9e3a4bff98ce28,"(CNN)The world learned his name after he was killed by a South Carolina police officer. But in his life, 50-year-old Walter Scott was also the father of four children and served in the Coast Guard before being honorably discharged. ""He was outgoing -- loved everybody, (was) very known in the community and got along with everybody,"" his brother Anthony Scott told CNN's Don Lemon. ""All the family loves him, and his kids loved him."" Until it all came crashing down Saturday morning, when North Charleston police Officer Michael Slager pulled Scott over, reportedly for a faulty brake light. Dash cam video released Thursday shows the two talking, then shows Scott get out of his car and run. Why did he run? Justin Bamberg, a lawyer for Scott's family, speculated Thursday it could have been related to ""child support and a fear of maybe going back to (jail)."" At the time of his death, Scott owed over $18,000 in back payments for two children and hadn't made a payment since July 2012, according to Charleston County family court documents. Another family lawyer, Chris Stewart, acknowledged that Scott had been arrested previously for outstanding warrants for not paying child support, but Stewart said that had been Scott's lone issue with the law for the past 20 years. ""I know that it had nothing to do with anything violent,"" Bamberg said of Scott's legal history. ""He was not a dangerous person."" According to a police report, Scott did not comply with an officer's demands and tried to grab Slager's stun gun. Slager fired eight shots, five of which struck Scott. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Regardless of why Walter Scott ran, ""running from an officer doesn't result in the death penalty,"" Stewart said. Slager has been charged with murder, a charge that might not have come about if not for a bystander's video of the shooting. Anthony Scott said he watched the video that showed his brother getting shot dead, footage that has traumatized the family. ""When I saw that video for the first time, my family was deeply hurt that someone would gun down a human being in that way,"" the brother said. ""We just couldn't believe it."" The last time the family got together with Walter Scott was when the siblings threw a surprise wedding anniversary party for their parents. ""It was a great celebration,"" Anthony Scott said. ""My dad and brothers planned it, and (my mother) was totally surprised. ""Now this happens,"" Scott said, referring to his brother's shooting. ""It's so tragic.""

The teenagers and young adults, who have faced discrimination  throughout their entire lives, are the subjects of a new independent documentary. The film, also named Check It, explains how many of the youths have been stabbed or shot at, while others have served time in juvenile prisons . But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members, who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Documentary star: This is one of more than 200 members of Check It, the only documented gang of gay and transgender youths in America . Impoverished area: The gang members, many of whom have been stabbed and shot at, have faced discrimination throughout their lives . Transformation: They are now the subjects of a new independent film, which tells of how some of them have served time in juvenile prisons . Dressing up: But now, the 'tight-knit' gang members (including this member), who are aged 14 to 22, are fighting to break the cycle of poverty and violence that they have grown up in. They are working on their own clothing label, putting on fashion shows and working stints as models . Contrast: The documentary describes how the gang members have to deal with violence and fights on a regular basis (left) but have now launched their own fashion label (right: a youth models for the label) in a bid to escape their 'often brutal' lives in Trinidad, Washington DC . They have set up their own clothing label and are putting on fashion shows in the north-east neighborhood, according to the film and an Indiegogo page. And some of them are even working stints as runway models. All the while, they are offering each other unconditional love and support. 'At its heart, the film explores the undying friendship that exists between these kids - an unbreakable bond that is tested every day,' the page states. However, amid their achievements, the youths often encounter setbacks, with the community they live in 'relentlessly trying to beat them down'. 'When The Check It are not taking small steps forward on the catwalk, they too often take massive steps backwards,' the page explains. The documentary follows the members, led by ex-convict Mo, as they get into fights, are ridiculed by passerbys and struggle with their fashion plans.

The 10 were arrested in Swat, a district of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Pakistani army spokesman Maj. Gen. Asim Bajwa said last September. That was nearly two years after the then 15-year-old Yousafzai -- who was despised by Taliban militants for her outspoken support of girls' right to an education -- was shot as she was traveling home on a school bus.

A clip of the video, which features a gay couple holding hands, got the 18+ rating from the independent TV Rain channel in Russia on Monday. The channel told CNN that it didn't want to break the controversial law, which bans ""propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations around minors"" and bars public discussion of gay rights and relationships within earshot of children. ""There are no legal precedents for this law, so we just don't know what comes under this law and (what) doesn't,"" a TV Rain spokesperson told CNN. ""Therefore, fearing to break the law -- especially given the high attention to TV Rain from the supervising authorities -- we decided to put a marker (on the video)."" Clinton's video was released over the weekend to announce the start of her 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. It features about five seconds of two men holding hands. One of the men says, ""I'm getting married this summer to someone I really care about."" The former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013, saying that ""gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights."" Russia's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the Russian Parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July 2013. Human Rights Watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as ""a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in Russia."" Rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and a number of bars around the world stopped serving Russian vodka in protest. U.S. President Barack Obama -- Clinton's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive. ""I have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them,"" Obama told Jay Leno in 2013. Putin defended the law, noting that unlike other countries, Russia decriminalized homosexual relationships (in 1993). ""We don't outlaw anything and don't nab anyone,"" he said before the 2014 Games. ""That's why you can feel safe and free here,"" he added, ""but please leave our children in peace."" The rights group ILGA-Europe said in a May 2014 report that Russia was the worst place in Europe (out of 49 countries) for LGBTI people to live.

A relative of Britain's youngest convicted terrorist is believed to be among two  teenagers who have fled into Syria to join Isis. The pair from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, have not been in contact with their families for several days and cannot be reached on their mobile phones. One of the boys is believed to be a relation of Hammaad Munshi, who was just 15 when he joined a cell of Islamic fanatics targeting the Royal Family. The grandson of a British sharia judge, Munshi was recruited by a leading 'cyber terrorist' who radicalised impressionable Muslims and encouraged them to attend military camps in Pakistan. He was arrested on his way home from a chemistry exam in 2006 and found with two bags of ball-bearings - key material for a suicide vest. He was locked up for two years under the Terrorism Act in 2008. The Times reported that the two 17-year-old boys told relatives that they were going on a school trip, but instead used the Easter holidays as a 'window of opportunity' to flee Britain. They are thought to have boarded a Thomas Cook flight from Manchester Airport to Dalaman in Turkey on March 31, said West Yorkshire Police. Both families have reported the boys missing to police although British authorities now fear that the pair have managed to cross into Syria from Turkey. A family friend said they were in a state 'of total disbelief' and they were 'broken and inconsolable'. The south Dewsbury area has been linked to a number of extremist plots and was home to the ring-leader of the London bombings on July 7, 2005, Mohammad Sidique Khan. According to The Times, a member of one of the families said: 'We don't want to talk.' Assistant Chief Constable Mark Milsom, from West Yorkshire Police said: 'We are extremely concerned for the safety of these two boys and would urge anyone with information to come forward and speak to us. 'Syria is an extremely dangerous place and the public will be aware of the dangers these boys may face. 'The choice of returning home from Syria is often taken away from those that come under the control of Islamic State, leaving their families in the UK devastated and with very few options to secure their safe return.' The force said it has been supporting the missing teenagers’ families and carrying out extensive inquiries alongside the North East Counter Terrorism Unit. The disappearance of the two teenagers follows the arrest of nine Britons by Turkish authorities attempting to sneak into Syria across the Turkish border. Waheed Ahmed, 21, from Rochdale was arrested with his aunt, cousins and four children while attempting to get into Syria. Scroll down for video . 'Seeking jihad': Two teenage boys from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, are believed to have fled to Syria to join Isis militants, seen here taking control of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus . After the arrest, anti-terror police raided the home of his father, Shakil Ahmed, a respected Labour councillor for the town. Munshi's family comes from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire, where his grandfather Yakub Munshi ran the town's sharia court. The schoolboy, who was studying for his GCSEs at Westborough High School in Kirklees, West Yorkshire, was traced through his online conversations with 'cyber terrorist' Aabid Hussain Khan. In one MSN chat, they argued how best to sneak a metal sword through airport security. Munshi had painstakingly scoured the internet for details on how to make napalm and grenades. He claimed he had only done the research out of curiosity but handwritten notes hidden under his bed revealed his burning desire to travel abroad to become a martyr. The boys are from the same town as London 7/7 suicide bomber Mohammed Siddique Khan (pictured) Munshi also had a library of videos, documents and audio clips showing acts of jihad, mujaheddin fighters and Al Qaeda preachings. He was arrested as he walked home from school after an exam. Khan, who acted as an administrator on an extremist website called Activion Publications, downloaded information on the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and Camilla, Prince Edward, the Countess of Wessex, The Duke of York and the Princess Royal. Munshi was convicted of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism. Khan was found guilty of possessing articles for a purpose connected with terrorism but cleared of a similar charge. A third man, Sultan Muhammad from Manningham, West Yorkshire - Khan's cousin - was convicted of three similar charges and one of making a record of information likely to be useful in terrorism.","Two 17-year-olds have not been in contact with families for several days .

The detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters’ She said the detective camera gave amateur photographers the opportunity to capture the true essence of life on Sydney streets, defining it as a ‘real revolution and turning point in photography.’ ‘This was really the beginning of the mass photography you see today. It parallels with the way people look at the world now, always taking images with their phones,’ she said. ‘The word snapshot emerged from this style of photography and the photographers were called snap shooters,’ Ms Riley added. She said that this was the first time people would’ve been confronted with the idea of being photographed or observed on the streets without their knowledge,  spurring on early conversations about privacy laws. This was the first time people were confronted with the idea of being photographed without their knowledge . The camera was wrapped in a small parcel so that it didn't draw attention from the photographers subjects . 'Pesky snap shooters' were the reason people initated early talks about surveillance and privacy . ‘It definitely caused some controversy,' she said. ‘There were plenty of people being annoyed by pesky snap shooters roaming the streets, taking photos of unsuspecting people going about their business.’ The Detective Camera was produced between 1883 and 1887 using a dry negative which was already loaded into the device. It was focused and ready to take a photograph from around six feet away. The camera was loaded, focused and ready to take a photograph at around six feet away . ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ It was the first time individuals who weren't trained in the science and chemistry of photography had the opportunity to dabble in the art. ‘Not long after this camera was marketed the roll film and Kodak camera box were invented. ‘These photographs are very rare and unique because they represent the missing link between the old style tripod photography and Kodak box photography.’ The photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history . ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation' Ms Riley thinks photos taken with the hand held camera captured more natural gestures and poses giving us a better sense of the streets and a far more accurate view of our history. ‘You get to see some really lovely scenes of youthful anticipation. One of the photos shows a group of girls dressed to the nines, many with bare feet- something that was quite normal for that time.’ She said it is important to share this link to our past to ‘encourage people to build a bridge between then and now.’ The candid shots give us a better look at what life was really like for Sydneysiders in the 1880's . People from the Flickr community helped identify landmarks and other details in the photos to help locate where they were taken. This shot is on the corner of Elizabeth and King Street in Sydney's CBD . The images were collected over a period of time and were originally released on the photo hosting website Flickr. They received a 'wonderful response' from the Flickr community with some members even reaching out and helping curators identify where in Sydney the photos were taken. The Crowd Source exhibition will run from April 4 until August 23. ‘We want to share these images and encourage people to build a bridge between then and now’","The State Library is showing a collection of photographs taken in the 1800's by the first hand held camera .

Editor Lawrence Booth, also a respected cricket writer with Sportsmail, uses his notes to take England to task after a tumultuous year spent trying to recover from the bitter fall-out of losing the last Ashes series 5-0. English cricket, says Booth in the 152nd edition of the fabled Almanack, which is published on Wednesday, 'repeatedly lost touch with the basic idea that the national team belongs to us all'. Wisden editor Lawrence Booth has launched a stinging attack on the ECB's handling of Kevin Pietersen . The star batsman will ply his trade for Surrey in a bid to reclaim his spot in the England Test team . And he continues: 'A few wins might have deflected attention from a charge sheet that would include the mishandling of the Kevin Pietersen affair, worrying Test attendances outside London, a head in the sand attitude to the one-day team and - not yet a decade after the 2005 Ashes had presented English cricket with a golden chance to attract a new generation to the sport – a fall in the number of recreational players. 'Starting with the drubbing in Australia, England lost eight full series out of all across the formats in 2014, to say nothing of their defeat by the Netherlands at the World Twenty20. In all, they lost 28 games. Only once had this been surpassed in a calendar year by one of the eight major teams – the dysfunctional 2010 Pakistanis. 'National selector James Whitaker had called Cook ""our exceptional leader""; Paul Downton, the ECB's new managing director, hailed Peter Moores as the ""outstanding coach of his generation"". It was a nexus of self-preservation yet, as the wagons circled, the wheels kept threatening to fall off.' The Wisden editor is just as scathing about England's decision to sack Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the drink of what turned out to be the most disastrous World Cup in England's history. Peter Moores presided over a disastrous World Cup but was labelled 'the outstanding coach of his generation' by the ECB's new managing director Paul Downton . The beleaguered Alastair Cook was stripped of the one-day captaincy before the World Cup debacle . 'To leave the sacking of Cook so late made little sense,' says Booth. 'Had he stepped down in August after the 3-1 Test win over India he could have done so with his post-Ashes reputation partly restored. This would have allowed him to gather strength for the ludicrous run of 17 Tests in less than 10 months, starting in Great Optimism in Antigua in April 2015 and ending in Near Exhaustion in South Africa in January 2016. (As someone pointed out, 17 Tests are almost a third of Don Bradman's career.) 'Trouble was, Cook had become more than just a cricketer: cast by his employers in the role of latter-day saint to Pietersen's fallen angel, he was now an article of faith. Giles Clarke (the ECB chairman) even suggested the Cooks were ""very much the sort of people we want the England captain and his family to be"" which was all well and good but couldn't stop him edging behind. Downton, Whitaker and Moores were all bound up with his fate. Cook had to succeed, as much for others as himself. It was an intolerable position. 'England overplayed their hand. The Test win over a supine India did not mean Cook would effect a similar transformation of the one-day side. This seemed obvious to everyone – except to the men who run the game.' But Booth, who also writes for Sportsmail, says Cook's eventual sacking so late made little sense . National selector James Whitaker (right) had called Cook 'our exceptional leader' Pietersen appeared on the Graham Norton Show - the presenter suggested 'team sport's not for you' England also come under attack for the way they handled the sacking of Pietersen, a situation where they had right on their side - plus the support of the bulk of those who follow the team around professionally - but somehow allowed the maverick to claim the morale high ground. A situation that, incredibly, is still going on, after Wisden went to press on this year's edition. 'The ECB's comments on the fall-out with Pietersen should have been clear and concise,' writes Booth. 'If you're widely regarded as a pain it helps if you're scoring lots more runs than anyone else. Instead, England botched the PR battle. They hinted that some darker truth about his behaviour would emerge once a confidentiality agreement expired in October. Yet the lull merely prolonged the fiasco. And, when the dirt failed to materialise, the ECB looked rudderless. Worse, in the eyes of those agitating for an explanation, they looked indifferent. 'It was typical of a story beyond ECB's control that their best moment was not of their own making. Having searched in vain for the words that justified his sacking, they were gifted a 324-page solution, an autobiography so full of rancour that BBC chat-show host Graham Norton suggested to Pietersen: ""Maybe, just maybe, team sport's not for you."" This year's Wisden also includes both a withering review of Pietersen's nasty book by the Mail on Sunday's Patrick Collins, who retired this year after a distinguished career, and an excellent piece of the aspect of his career totally overlooked by Pietersen in his book – batting that touched genius. Simon Hughes admirably fills the void that Pietersen left himself. Gary Ballance has been named one of Wisden's five cricketers of the year in the new edition . Ballance's Yorkshire team-mate Adam Lyth, called up by England, is also in the top five . Jeetan Patel (left) and Angelo Mathews make up the remainder of Booth's top five cricketers . Sri Lanka's brilliant Kumar Sangakkara clinched the title of leading cricketer in the world . Australia's Meg Lanning (batting against England) is honoured with the inaugural women's award . The thousands of disciples of Wisden always look immediately at who the editor has chosen as his five cricketers of the year, one of the oldest and most highly regarded prizes in sport. Booth has chosen well and predictably in the cases of Moeen Ali, who has the honour of being pictured on the front cover, Gary Ballance, Adam Lyth and Angelo Mathews and enterprisingly in Jeetan Patel, who is rewarded for his prolific season for Warwickshire. To me, the award suffers in that players are only allowed to be picked once. For instance, how good would it be if, on his retirement, a player would be described as a five-time Wisden cricketer of the year? Booth is a progressive, brilliant, imaginative editor but perhaps such a move would be just a little too controversial for such a traditional vehicle as Wisden. The brilliant Kumar Sangakkara, who will be delighting championship audiences with Surrey this summer, is the leading cricketer in the world while, for the first time, there is an international woman cricketer of the year. Australia's Meg Lanning is honoured with the inaugural women's award. As ever, Wisden is a must for any cricket fan and even at a time of continuing turmoil for the England team and genuine concerns about cricket's future world-wise, it is a reassuring presence however critical the editor is of it. Moeen Ali (England and Worcestershire) England’s search for a spin bowler to replace Graeme Swann was thought to be doomed – until Moeen Ali lit up the summer with 12 wickets in the Southampton and Manchester Tests against India. He finished the series with 19 at 23 apiece. Earlier in the season he had almost saved the Headingley Test against Sri Lanka, batting for all bar one ball of the final day. And, when he was promoted to open for the one-day side, he scored the third-fastest hundred by an England batsman, from 72 balls against Sri Lanka in Colombo. Moeen Ali celebrates taking the wicket of India's Cheteshwar Pujara at Old Trafford last summer . Gary Ballance (England and Yorkshire) Gary Ballance began the summer with a century in his first home Test, against Sri Lanka at Lord’s, and followed up with two more against India – at Lord’s and Southampton. By the end of the season he boasted a Test average of over 60. Gary Ballance celebrates reaching his century during the third test with India in Southampton last year . Adam Lyth (England and Yorkshire) Yorkshire opening batsman Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the County Championship, with 1,489 runs at an average of 67 and six hundreds, and was one of the pillars of his team’s triumph. He was rewarded with a place on England’s tour of the Caribbean in April 2015. Yorkshire's Adam Lyth was the leading run-scorer in the 2014 County Championship season . Angelo Mathews (Sri Lanka) Angelo Mathews was the inspiration behind Sri Lanka’s first Test series victory in England. After helping to save the First Test at Lord’s with a century, he made 160 – and took four wickets – as Sri Lanka came from behind to win in Leeds. Mathews also led his team to wins in the one-day series and the one-off Twenty20 international. Angelo Mathews after making 160 for Sri Lanka in the second Test with England at Headingley . Jeetan Patel (New Zealand and Warwickshire) New Zealand off-spinner Jeetan Patel was central to Warwickshire’s success across all three formats. He claimed 107 victims in total, more than anyone in the country, and his 25 wickets in the NatWest T20 Blast – the most in the competition – helped his side lift the trophy on home turf at Edgbaston. Jeetan Patel takes the final wicket as Warwickshire beat Middlesex in last year's County Championship .","Wisden editor Lawrence Booth launched an attack on English cricket .

The former Celtic and Barcelona striker had no option but to play Daniel Andersson  with goalkeepers Par Hansson and Matt Pyzdrowski out injured. Astonishingly, the emergency stopper kept a clean sheet as Helsinborg drew 0-0 against Kalmar in the Allsvenskan season opener. Helsinborg manager Henrik Larsson was forced to play 42-year-old kit man Daniel Andersson in goal . Speaking to local TV after the game, Andersson - a retired goalkeeper who earned one cap for Sweden in 2001 - said: 'It was a scenario that I never could have prepared myself for. Going from kit man, to goalie coach, to playing. 'I am a goalie coach first and foremost. But now I have set the standard.' Larsson added: 'You have to be impressed. He [Andersson] is almost 43 and didn’t make a mistake in this game. I’m very happy to have Daniel Andersson multi-tasking for our club.' Andersson made 130 appearances for the club between 2004 and 2009 and also spent a season with Scottish club Hibernian during a 22-year playing career.

Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, regularly makes videos and posts on social media about life in the so-called Islamic State under the name Abu Sa'eed Al-Britani. Last month he complained about peeling potatoes and his troubles with washing his clothes. In his latest video the former Morrisons security guard, who used to live at home with his mother and has not managed to get himself a jihadi bride, accuses a fellow 'brother' of running away from the frontline in Syria 'When it was only him and me defending the post'. Omar Hussain, 27, from High Wycombe, posts videos online under the name Abu Sa'eed Al-Britani. He has complained about jihadis who leave their posts then boasting on social media about their bravery . Islamic State fighters pose at the border between Syria and Iraq. Hussain has cautioned 'sisters' to choose wisely when searching for a spouse among ISIS fighters . A jihadi poses with a handgun and an ISIS ring in a social media post. Hussain has warned would-be jihadi brides to be wary of fighters who seem to spend too much time online . He said: 'I can recall myself shouting at him to come back as he ran away leaving me alone to defend the position. 'The ironical thing here was that the brother went online the next day and praised how Dawlah [Islamic State] managed to defend an onslaught by the enemy, and how people in the west need to ""stop being cowards"". 'On other occasions, I have noticed how some brothers praise how ""we"" attacked such and such village, how hard the battle was for ""us"", etc. yet they were not there. 'A form of tadlees (twisting the haqq [truth] to get self praise), not a characteristic stemming from humbleness and sincerity.' Hussain, who has previously issued advice on how jihadists should 'deal' with wannabe jihadi brides, has now cautioned 'sisters' to choose wisely when searching for a spouse among ISIS fighters. He said: 'Although there may be nothing wrong with marrying a brother who is constantly online, I would just like to say that its best one does not rush into a marriage contract. 'I have been in Sham [the Caliphate] for just over a year now and I have seen many beautiful brothers who are constant on their ibaadah [worship], warriors in front lines, have amazing military minds, generous towards others, humble, funny, etc. yet are unknown on social media. 'So sisters, please be careful and deliberate when choosing a spouse. We are still human beings, we err and we make mistakes. 'Some people's intentions can sidetrack, especially when on social media platforms.' A jihadi poses with an AK-47 and a handgun. Some fighters boast online about how 'we' attacked a village when they weren't even part of any ISIS assault, according to Hussein . Despite his hatred of the West this ISIS fighter enjoys showing off his Adidas trainers in this online post . Hussain himself poses with an AK-47 in Raqqa, Syria. He often posts videos containing his opinions on life inside the so-called Islamic State . The British jihadi decries boastful fellow fighters who are 'always on twitter posting pics of [themselves]' rather than actually fighting on the frontline - which should make would-be wives wary given electronic devices are banned there. He adds: 'The only reason a brother can be constantly on twitter, fb, Instagram or other social media platform, is if he's not on front lines.' Hussain continues that all ISIS members in the area controlled by the group have guns and not just the fighters. 'Just because someone is in Sham and has a gun, it does not mean they are a Mujaahid,' he says. 'Immaturity makes a person over excited. And being over excited leads to posting pics online with a gun. 'Do not be afraid to reject a proposal, there are many brothers here in Sham. And some of the most beautiful are those who are always on ribat [the frontline] and completely unknown on social media platforms.' And in a missive posted yesterday Hussain railed against jihadis who moan 'like menstruating women' about the guns they've been given. Jihadists based in Atmeh - just one mile from the Olive Tree refugee camp in Syria - have boasted of living 'the goodly life' in a huge hilltop villa - a far cry from the frontline in the country's brutal civil war . Bethnal Green teenagers Kadiza Sultana, Shamima Begum and Amira Abase all ran away from their homes apparently to be jihadi brides. Hussain says such girls should chose their husbands carefully . It is feared the three are now married to ISIS fighters. Hussain has complained at how some moan like 'menstruating women' at the guns they have been given . Hussain admits on Twitter that it took him 50 minutes to peel 10 potatoes - leaving him too tired to cut them . He says to his 'beloved brothers in Islam': 'Know that yesterday you had nothing of honor in your hands and were subjugated under the laws of the Kuffar [unbeliever] . 'You carried no bullets, no gun, no grenade, nothing of this sort. Yet here you are today with honor given to you, so do not boast about what you have been given. 'For you have been given it due to the sacrifices of your brothers before you…The soldiers who fought the battles while you were sitting at home. 'Likewise, do not complain when you are given a gun which you do not like… What were you walking around with last month? In Dar Al-Kufr [any non-Muslim country], did you have a brand new Russian AK47? 'Did you have a Glock? You didn’t even have a rusty old gun, yet here you are complaining like a menstruating woman about the very find details of your gun!' Yet Hussain has form when it comes to spending a time posting on social media rather than taking the fight to ISIS' Syrian government or Kurdish enemies or dodging US airstrikes - and he's not averse to sharing pictures of himself brandishing an AK-47 either. Earlier this month he complained on Twitter about his difficulties completing the most basic daily jobs including peeling potatoes for his dinner and washing his clothes. In August Last August he appeared on BBC2's Newsnight, saying: 'I hate the UK, the only reason why I would intend to return to the UK is when I want to come and plant a bomb somewhere.'","Omar Hussain, from High Wycombe, often posts about life in Islamic State .

74e204d17406b0bfb69ae91384c838318ac797ff,"Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor may have taken the spotlight over the past two weeks when it comes to the UFC's featherweight division, but this weekend it's time for two other top ranked 145ers to take centre stage, as No 1 ranked Chad Mendes and No 4 ranked Ricardo Lamas meet in Fairfax, in a bout which could potentially determine the next challenger to the title. Mendes' only two professional losses have come at the hands of the Brazilian king and Lamas also dropped a decision to Aldo when the two met in February last year. But it is Aldo's upcoming opponent, Irishman McGregor, who has dominated conversation in the lead up to this weekend's fight. Opponents Chad Mendes and Ricardo Lamas face off during the UFC weigh-in at the Patriot Center . Lamas holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym on in Fairfax, Virginia . 'I thought Aldo handled it well' said Team Alpha Male's Mendes, when asked about Aldo's reaction to McGregor snatching the championship belt on stage in Dublin. 'But that's Conor, he is crazy, you know,' Mendes continued. 'Aldo has been the champion for a long time. Conor is the type of guy who is always going to run his mouth, but I highly doubt Aldo is going to let that get to him. I feel like whoever wins, I'm good. I think Aldo is a better mixed martial artist so I think he is going to win. He knows what he is doing - I just see him winning the fight.' A stark contrast to the championship pairing, Mendes and Lamas have shown nothing but respect for one another in the lead up to Saturday night's main event. Mendes flexes his guns at the weight-in before his clash with rival Lamas at the Patriot Centre . Mendes is put though his paces in front of the fans ahead of the fight against Lamas in Fairfield . Anticipating a war when they meet, 'Money' Mendes is confident that he is stronger than 'The Bully' in every department and that, should he win convincingly, he believes the fans will want to see him get a third crack at Aldo. 'I think Ricardo is a tough guy - he is good everywhere, you know. But the thing is, I feel like everything that he is good at, I'm just that little bit better,' he added. 'I'm hoping that if I win this fight, then enough people will want to watch a third fight between me and Aldo and that the UFC will give it to us, but we'll see what happens. 'If I can get out there and totally dominate, then hopefully that will be enough to get me another shot. I'm expecting a war out there - like I said, Lamas is a tough, tough fighter.' Mendes holds an open training session for fans and media at the UFC Gym in Fairfax, Virginia . And Mendes is not the only one eyeing up a second shot at the featherweight title. Chicago-born Lamas claims he is under no illusions that he will be in for an easy night with Mendes. 'If I keep performing well then the title shot will come,' he said. 'Mendes is a cool guy. He is a good sport and he is a respectful fighter. But this is going to be a tough fight and when it comes to the night, you're going to see us both try to go in there and take each other out. 'I feel like I am strong for my weight but Mendes is a powerhouse too, so we will see what happens. I feel like Chad is a great fighter so we're going to bring the best out of each other, for sure.' Lamas stretches his legs with a kick as he prepares to take on Mendes with an open training session . Meanwhile arguably two of the lightweight division's most exciting fighters, Jorge Masvidal and Al Iaquinta, meet in the co-main event - a bout which should showcase some of the finest striking in the division.

b75253f5c9684d6b345e7fcd33e3ac2f7d2f5602,"Lausanne, Switzerland (CNN)The bad news? The deadline to agree on what will be the parameters for an endgame pact on Iran's nuclear program has come and gone with no deal. The good news? The sides are still talking. Whether your glass is half-full or half-empty, it doesn't change the fact that it's not easy to reach resolutions on complex issues involving nuclear physics and international relations. Nor does it change the fact that Tuesday's self-imposed deadline didn't really matter anyway: The date that really counts is June 30, when the parties must figure out a comprehensive deal -- with all the technical details and diplomatic impasses fully worked out -- or else everything falls apart. The whole point of what's happening in Lausanne, Switzerland, is to get everyone on the same page about what kinds of things will be discussed as part of a potential conclusive agreement. For those hoping that will eventually happen, it's good that Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and senior European Union diplomat Helga Schmid held talks early Thursday morning in Lausanne. But it doesn't mean there will be a final deal. ""We have made significant progress over the last few days, but it has been slow going,"" British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond told reporters Wednesday. ""I'm optimistic that we will make further progress ... but it does mean the Iranians being willing to meet us where there are still issues to deal with. ""Fingers crossed, and we'll hope to get there during the course of the day."" But by Thursday morning, there was still no deal. Zarif told reporters that Iran has shown ""its readiness to engage with dignity, and it's time for our negotiating partners to seize the moment and use this opportunity, which may not be repeated."" ""I've always said that an agreement and pressure do not go together. They are mutually exclusive,"" the Iranian minister said. ""So our friends need to decide whether they want to be with Iran based on respect or whether they want to continue based on pressure. They have tested the other one. It is high time to test this one."" U.S. State Department official Marie Harf said on Twitter that talks between Kerry and Zarif ran deep into the early hours of Thursday morning. ""That was truly an all-nighter,"" she tweeted around 6 a.m. local time (12 a.m. ET), saying the negotiations had broken up and would resume again in a few hours. ‎Another U.S. official had said earlier that ""some serious issues remain unresolved."" ""It is still totally unclear when this might happen, if it happens at all."" There's one thing that most everyone does agree on: The sides have made progress in recent days. In fact, Zarif called it ""very good"" progress that led to solutions on most issues, according to IRNA, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. As long as ""the conversations continue to be productive,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said, U.S. officials will keep on talking. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov -- whose country has been taking part in the talks, along with Germany, France, Britain and the European Union -- went so far as to say ""with a large degree of confidence"" that ""framework agreements have been reached on all the key aspects of this issue at the ministerial level."" ""We hope that these agreements will be put on paper in the next few hours or a day at the most,"" Lavrov said before leaving the talks along with his counterparts from China and France. ""The agreement stipulates a comprehensive approach to settling this issue, including IAEA verification of the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran's nuclear program and detailed provisions on lifting the sanctions."" But it doesn't matter if Russia or Germany is comfortable with the details; the key is getting the United States and Iran on the same page, something that's hard given the decades of contempt and distrust.  According to an IRNA report, Zarif said only that he hopes a framework agreement will be drafted Wednesday. ""I think it's a matter of political will. It's not just about technical details anymore,"" said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle East studies at the London School of Economics. ""You're talking here about an institutionalized relationship of hostility between the United States and Iran."" Even then, Gerges on Wednesday gave the sides a 60% to 70% chance of coming to some sort of preliminary agreement soon. His reasoning: ""I think there is a convergence of interests between Obama's administration and the Iranian leadership, and that's why both camps have a vested interest in signing an agreement, as opposed to walking away."" For Iran, which insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, a deal would mean relief from punishing economic sanctions. For the West, it would offer hope of improved relations with Tehran without the destabilizing threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb in the pipeline. The sides have oftentimes talked past each other for nine years. That's why Iran is facing crippling sanctions in the first place: because many world powers felt they could not trust Tehran, given its dealings with nuclear inspectors and in talks. The tone changed with the 2013 election of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who campaigned on a platform of reducing international tensions. And there has been some movement, including in recent days, out of Iran. Still, it's too early to say that everyone will meet in the middle on everything. Mohammad Marandi, a professor of North American studies at Tehran University, told CNN that Iranian officials feel they've already compromised a lot in the talks. ""They feel that they've gone as far as they possibly can and that it's for the Americans right now to make a move,"" he said. 21 questions on Iranian nuclear talks . The main sticking points at the moment are believed to be the pace at which U.N. sanctions on Iran will be lifted, how much nuclear research and development Iran will be able to maintain and whether Iran will ship its stockpile of enriched uranium out of the country for reprocessing into a safer form. Even if those points are resolved to the satisfaction of all sides, any agreement is expected to come under attack on multiple fronts. Obama is likely to face a stern challenge selling any deal to Congress, while hardliners in Iran will probably denounce it for being too harsh. The leader of Israel, a key U.S. ally that considers Iran to be an existential threat, on Tuesday said ""the agreement that is being formed in Lausanne is paving the road to that result."" And on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu obliquely suggested that the United States could be threatened as well. ""The Middle East is plagued by anti-Western, anti-democratic and anti-American extremism. ... Despots lead their people in chants of 'Death to America' while building intercontinental ballistic missiles to reach America. In this violent and unstable region, where states are exploding,"" said Netanyahu, referring to some Iranian leaders and reports that Iran could develop intercontinental missiles. Iran's power rises, with or without deal . Obama administration officials say that any agreement would involve heavy monitoring of Iran's nuclear activities. They insist no deal would be better than signing a bad deal. But if no agreement is reached and the talks fall apart, the potential consequences are deeply unsettling. Further sanctions on Iran would most likely follow. Israel argues that could eventually force Tehran back to the negotiating table to settle for a tougher deal.

However, this did not appear to cross the mind of teenager Lily Sharp, who lives in the UK, when she decided to prank her own mother. Rather than put a whoopie cushion on her chair or balance flower on top of a door, Lily decided to amuse herself by faking her own kidnapping- any parents worse fear. As mean-spirited as the joke appeared, Lily certainly took the steps in order to make the prank as convincing as possible. Scroll down for video . Lily Sharp perhaps took a joke too far after convincing her own mother she had been kidnapped . She began by texting her mother a seemingly innocent message: 'You didn't tell me the decorator man was coming mate!' Before adding in a quick reference from the famous Liam Neeson kidnapping film Taken. She continued: 'I thought I was guna get taken man. Thought he was tryna trick me into getting into the house' (sic) before adding, 'Not happy young lady.' Lily began her prank by convincing her mother that she had allowed a stranger to enter their home . She then took the prank a step further by pretending to her panicked mum that the intruder had her phone, informing her mother that the kidnapper would require £4000 for her return . Her suspicious mother replies immediately with: 'Whaaaat? What decorator?!?!! Call me. There is no decorator.' Lily then plays on her mother's fears by pretending that the intruder now has possession of the phone simply replying: 'She knows that now.' At this point Lily's mother is completely fooled and has become more frantic insisting that her daughter calls her immediately. 'Who knows it!! Call me please' she replies before adding, 'Now' After her mother reveals that she is sending the police round Lily reveals that it was all a trick . She convinces her mother by sending a picture of herself, her mother does not find it amusing . At this point many would have called their panicking parent however Lily decides to take it up a notch. 'My name is Victor' she replies before demanding a ransom 'I have your child. I want £4000 to get her back.' Lily's mother tries to keep calm texting back: 'Sending a neighbour round now' But Lily simply insights more panic in her mother when she replies: 'Good luck with that. I've already gone. She's with me.' At this point Lily's mother informs who she believes to be the intruder that she has called the police: 'Ok well police will be.' Lily attempts one more cheeky text as the intruder with 'She says hello' before revealing that it was all a trick. She then reassures her mum by sending a picture of herself perched on their sofa. Predictably the mother does not take this well ending the conversation by swearing at her daughter. Although her mother may not have found the joke funny, after posting a photo of the messages on Twitter, Lily received 18,000 retweets and 25,000 favourites.","Lily Sharp convinced her mother that she had been kidnapped .

55f2025154bee234dde49693138da15b907ee0f6,"A British couple face being stranded in Spain for at least three months after their baby boy was born 12 weeks prematurely during a family holiday. Karla Hornby said she thought she was going to die when she gave birth to baby Freddie, weighing just 2lbs, by emergency caesarean section while on holiday in Benidorm with her partner Jordan Jackson. The couple have now been told they will have to stay in Spain for at least three months while Freddie builds up his strength. But Mr Jackson, 21, a soldier in the army's Royal Logistics corps, who has served in Afghanistan, is meant to report back for service tomorrow. Stranded: Karla Hornby and Jordan Jackson are facing the prospect of spending three months in Spain while their baby boy Freddie builds up his strength. Ms Hornby also has a daughter Charlie, seven (pictured) Premature: Freddie weighed just 2lbs after being born by emergency caesarean section while on holiday in Benidorm. His mother has spoken of her surprise after suddenly going into labour 12 weeks prematurely . The pair had travelled to the Spanish resort for a final relaxing break before Ms Hornby was due to give birth in three months' time. Ms Hornby, who is already a mum to seven-year-old Charlie, had been cleared to fly by medical staff but was given a surprise when she suddenly went into labour. The 29-year-old said: 'On Saturday we were relaxing by the pool when my waters suddenly broke - I was in complete and utter shock.' She was taken to hospital, where doctors found that she was already 2cm dilated and transferred her to a bigger hospital. 'Jordan wasn't allowed in the ambulance with me and the staff didn't speak any English so I had no idea what was going on - my contractions were getting stronger,' Ms Hornby added. Costly trip: Freddie's family from Bolton, Greater Manchester, have so far been able to use insurance to pay for medical costs but they are now facing the prospect of supporting themselves in Spain for three months . Shocked: Ms Hornby thought she was going to die when she gave birth three months prematurely . 'In hospital I was bleeding heavily - it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to me. 'I had one big contraction and bled heavily, so they rushed me to theatre - I was shaking and I couldn't breathe, I thought I was going to die.' An emergency c-section was performed but the couple weren't able to see Freddie until the following evening. She said: 'I couldn't stop crying, I was so relieved that he was OK but he just looked so small - I was desperate to pick him up.' The family from Bolton, Greater Manchester, have been able to use insurance to pay for medical costs but have already had to pay £1,000 for a hotel. They are now facing the prospect of supporting themselves in Spain for at least three months as Freddie gains the strength needed to fly home. Their family and friends are doing everything they can to raise money to help and a funding website has already raised more than £900. Mr Jackson's mother, Vickie Cunliffe, said: 'It has been so frightening for everyone - we are just trying to think of as many ways as possible to raise money to help them.' Ms Hornby's best friend Lisa Johnston said: 'We just want as many people as possible to get in touch and do what they can to help them survive over there.'

The couple's baby boy arrived unexpectedly after Ms Amos went into labour prematurely while the pair were sightseeing in New York . The case of little Freddie is not the first time a premature baby born abroad has left a couple stranded. Earlier this year fellow British couple Katie Amos, 30, and fiancé Lee Johnston, 29, got stuck in New York with a £130,000 medical bill after their baby son was born 11 weeks prematurely while they were on a four-day getaway. The couple welcomed son Dax unexpectedly after Ms Amos went into labour while sightseeing in the Big Apple. The pair, whose son weighed just 3lbs, were told by doctors the newborn was not able to fly back to the family home in Burgh-le-Marsh, Lincolnshire, until March. American doctors said the pair's medical bills would reach £130,000 ($200,000), leaving the couple stranded overseas with limited clothes and money.","Karla Hornby, 29, gave birth 12 weeks prematurely on holiday in Benidorm .

74fd0cce566d9bc7a67c14159a0a4d2999faa423,"Scottish football's relationship with television has become a form of Stockholm Syndrome. No one is tied up in a basement. There are no hostages. Yet the lengths to which the SPFL will go to show love to those broadcasters who hold a gun to their heads has become a source of growing, simmering public fury. The Scottish game is engaged in a Faustian pact. And the television piper is calling the tune. Sky and BT Sports pay £16million a year for live coverage of Scottish football. The BBC puts in an estimated £3m a year for Sportscene highlights and radio commentaries. Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick during the win over Kilmarnock earlier this week . Compared with the £5billion paid to English clubs for Premiership football the sums are trifling. Borderline insulting. St Mirren facing Ross County on a wet March night in Paisley will never be a rival to the Manchester derby but broadcasters don't show Scottish football out of charity. They do so because it fills their schedules and meets a level of demand. In return for which they regard SPFL football with indifference. The BBC, a state public service broadcaster, charges the same flat rate licence tax to viewers in London and Manchester as it does to viewers in Glasgow and Inverness, with one key difference. English football is treated with reverence and respect. Scottish football like a pavement beggar. On Saturday, Hibernian and Falkirk fans will be asked to travel to Glasgow for a Scottish Cup semi-final which kicks off at 12.15pm Why? Because Sky Sports want the game out of the way to show a recorded documentary on Bob Paisley. On Sunday, Inverness fans must travel 200 miles for another 12.15pm kick-off against Celtic. Topping the bill in the afternoon is the European Cup rugby semi-final between Leinster and Toulon, a game likely to prompt complete indifference in public houses the length and breadth of Britain. It's not just the Scottish Cup. Celtic have played just four home league games at 3pm on a Saturday all season. And the decision to put back the Hearts v Rangers Championship clash 24 hours for the benefit of Sky caused an almighty row while resurrecting the dreaded 'sporting integrity' phrase. Hibernian are engaged in a battle with the Ibrox side for second place in the Championship. This matters because the team which finishes second has two fewer tense, troublesome play-off games to play. Were Rangers to go into their final game at Tynecastle needing only a point against Hearts — Hibernian's city rivals — the game would be played against an unparalleled backdrop of suspicion. To most — Leanne Dempster of Hibs and Hearts owner Ann Budge especially — the issue is one of fairness. It's clear cut. The games should always have kicked off at the same time and they believe the SPFL have been duplicitous and deceitful. Loathe to be seen criticising the SPFL, SFA chief executive Stewart Regan chose his words carefully, while all but admitting the league had made a complete and utter hash of things. Hamilton's Jason Scotland (right) challenges Dundee United's Calum Morris (left) during the SPL match . 'For 99 per cent of the time, there are no issues,' he said. 'Broadcasting in football has been operating for 20-30 years with big money coming into the game. Usually it's no problem at all. 'There are times — and we have one right now — where the broadcaster has a requirement to show a match at a particular time on a particular day and that causes issues. 'It's important for the league to consult with all of the interested parties, particularly the clubs who are the connecting point with the fans. 'Obviously, you can't please everybody but consultation is the secret. Neil Doncaster (SPFL chief) has been challenged by a number of different parties and I think it's important he listens and tries to come up with a pragmatic solution.' Minutes after Regan spoke, the SPFL's solution arrived in the shape of an embarrassing U-turn. As they should have been from the outset, the final-day Championship games were all rearranged for Saturday May 2. With a 12.15pm kick-off, naturally. And after some cap doffing and bowing to the Sky paymasters. Most accept Doncaster is the paid hand of the most influential clubs in Scotland, with little real executive authority. His job is to act as a human shield for clubs and to put lipstick on a pig of a broadcasting deal. Yet the decision to put the Rangers fixture back heightened suspicions over both his competence and motives. In May 2013, the final game in Division Three for the Ibrox club — against Berwick Rangers — was shown live on television. The other four fixtures were immediately brought forward, too. A statement on the Rangers website confirmed the decision had been taken 'in the interests of fairness'. What changed between May 2013 and now? To those who believe the SPFL are hellbent on getting Rangers back into the top tier come what may, this was manna from heaven. 'It's a challenging time for the SPFL right now,' said Regan with a degree of understatement. 'I can see why fans are unhappy. 'Ultimately there's always a balance between the needs of the broadcasters and the needs of the clubs, the needs of the supporters and sponsors. 'When you're looking at a Scottish football landscape, where money is tight and a broadcaster is the biggest provider of income, that can't be ignored. I'm not saying it's right but they have to be heard.' The problem comes when paying customers believe the broadcasters are the only people being heard. St Mirren's Stephen Mallan (centre) is challenged by Ross County's Jackson Irvine (right) Scottish fans from across the UK are now routinely asked, at the drop of a hat, to change travel plans to facilitate Friday-night football and noon kick-offs on a Saturday or Sunday. Monday night games have also crept onto the schedules. And for what? Scottish viewers make up around nine per cent of Sky and BT Sport' s subscribers. Yet it now costs them more to cover two games between West Brom and Stoke than it does to fund an entire season of Scottish football. The BBC, meanwhile, pays Gary Lineker as much to present Match of the Day as they do for SPFL highlights and radio coverage. 'It's fair to say that the landscape we are in right now is challenging,' added Regan. 'When you look at the numbers that the Premier League delivered in England it blows everything out of the water. 'The Scottish football authorities — the league in particular — are fighting for what you would call the scraps from the table. 'I know that there is pressure being put on the BBC through a number of parties right now, including the Scottish Government, to try to see if there is any way to make an improvement in income that can be generated by further discussions. 'But, ultimately, the broadcaster will only pay market rate for the product they are buying. 'We are trying to get that market rate back up by collectively working on initiatives to improve our game, but it's not going to happen overnight.' The empty stands are a problem. The spectacle in the SPFL is often poor and does nothing to persuade Sky that Scottish football is worth paying out more cash. In a vicious circle, however, this attitude drives the crowds lower and lower. Many now speak openly, then, of Scottish football going cold turkey. Of subscriber boycotts or ending the abusive relationship with broadcasters altogether and streaming SPFL games online on a pay-per-view basis. Or having no coverage at all. When old hands of the Scottish game such as Sir Bob Kelly, Jim McLean and Jim Farry warned of the creeping dangers of live television they were dismissed as dinosaurs. Right now, they look like visionaries. Celtic fans sing during the win over Kilmarnock, which sees them three points clear at the top of the SPL .","Scottish football coverage is at the mercy of Sky and BT's schedules .
Yet, Scottish football is never afforded the same precedence as England's .
The demand for Scottish football is nearing an all-time low ."
a726904222fc9e3d5d59b88c562fc98eb8a7070f,"A multi-millionaire property developer's son is being questioned over the disappearance of a blonde waitress from a celebrity club popular with Premiership footballers and soap stars. Privately-educated Westley Capper, 37, has already admitted driving  Agnese Klavina, 30, away from the nightspot in the upmarket Costa del Sol resort of Puerto Banus. Police believe 5ft 7in Agnese was forced into the vehicle. And the overweight expat - who has never been publicly named - showed he was in little mood for co-operating by refusing to be questioned after being summonsed to court yesterday. Suspects Westley Capper (left) and co-accused Craig Porter outside court in Marbella yesterday after the hearing. They have both admitted being in the Mercedes with Agnese Klavina before she vanished . Agnese, 30, disappeared after a night out at glitzy Puerto Banus nightclub Aqwa Mist on September 6 . A Cessna private jet owned by John Capper, multi-millionaire father of accused son Westley Capper. The tail fin features his nickname Fred . Agnese with British boyfriend Michael Millis, who travelled to Spain to help the search for the 30-year-old . The Spanish judge investigating Agnese's disappearance from trendy Aqwa Mist, where footballer Ashley Cole, Hollywood star Eva Longoria and boxer Amir Khan have all partied, was last night expected to order a fresh round of DNA tests after his hopes of an early breakthrough in the case foundered. Capper, whose Essex-born dad John specialises in buying and selling luxury properties around the world, has had travel restrictions imposed on him while the investigation against him continues. Co-accused Craig Porter, 33, also declined to answer questions during a closed court hearing in Marbella. The two men left the hearing in an English-plated Range Rover they had left parked in a disabled bay near the court. Agnese, whose British boyfriend, Michael Millis, is a former owner of west London club Westbourne Studios, vanished on September 6 last year after leaving Aqwa Mist with the two Brits. She was spotted shortly before she left talking to a woman of Russian appearance and was wearing a multi-coloured halter neck dress and carrying a large white Louis Vuitton handbag. Friends reported her missing later the same week along with her mother and sister after they flew to Spain when she failed to respond to calls and messages. They discovered her clothes and bank cards were still at a nearby flat where she was staying. Her friends and relatives put up missing posters around Marbella and the neighbouring resort of Puerto Banus. They also set up the 'Find Agnese Klavina' Facebook page linked to a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for legal fees linked to the search. The waitress was spending the summer in Marbella after flying to the resort in May to start work as a receptionist at luxury beach club the Ocean Club. Capper has claimed he dropped her off near a flat she was staying at. The missing person notice for Agnese, who was spending the summer in Marbella before she vanished . Authorities are probing the possibility Agnese was killed and her body thrown into the sea from a motorboat belonging to Capper's family . Capper (left) claims he dropped off Agnese (right) near a flat she was staying at in Marbella for the summer . Agnese was allegedly illegally detained by Porter and Capper, according to police who have studied footage from Aqwa Mist's car park . Porter, from Liverpool, says he fell asleep on the back seat of a Mercedes they left the club in before the drop-off. Forensic experts discovered a blonde hair in the boot of the car during a sweep of the vehicle but were unable to discover who the hair belonged to during initial tests. Further tests are now expected to be ordered on the human hair and samples taken during a search of a motorboat belonging to Capper's family. The vessel was seized in a port in the province of Murcia, around 300 miles east of Marbella. Agnese is pictured partying at Aqwa Mist  shortly before she went missing in September . Authorities are probing the possibility Agnese was killed and her body thrown into the sea from the boat, which left a port in Fuengirola near Marbella days after she vanished. Capper and Porter are currently being investigated on suspicion of Agnese's illegal detention following the recovery of CCTV footage from Aqwa Mist's car park and a damning report by a Cracker-style criminal psychologist claiming her facial expressions show she did not leave the club voluntarily. A doorman at the club was initially arrested alongside them for allegedly obstructing police inquiries - but the case against him dropped after he and the two Brits took part in a police reconstruction of the last night Agnese was seen alive. The criminal inquiry is expected to become a homicide probe if new DNA tests show Agnese was in the boot of the car or on the motorboat. Neither suspect has yet been formally charged with any crime, as is normal in Spain in the early stages of an investigation. A secrecy order had been placed over the case, giving lawyers acting for the British suspects and Agnese's family limited access to information. The order has now been lifted and the distraught mum and sister of Latvian-born Agnese, who was spending her summer working in Marbella after leaving her London home of the past five years, are now expected to be allowed to meet judicial authorities in Spain so they can be briefed on the investigation. Aqwa Mist is one of four Marbella venues owned by international restaurant brand La Sala, whose shareholders include ex-Tottenham Hotspur players winger David Bentley and defender Dean Austin. Footballer Ashley Cole is said to have spent £12,000 on champagne he then sprayed over his friends during a night out at Aqwa Mist the summer before last.

Hollywood star Eva Longoria, American actor and singer Terence Howard and boxer Amir Khan have also partied there since its opening in June 2012. The stars of BAFTA award-winning reality TV soap opera TOWIE are also summer regulars at the club, which bills itself as Marbella's number one party venue. Lawyers acting for the two Brits refused to comment as they left court. A court official confirmed: 'Both suspects declined to answer questions from the judge. 'The investigation is ongoing.' A source close to the case said: 'The judge has indicated he will order fresh DNA tests which may involve the use of Agnese's mum's DNA. 'He had important questions to ask the suspects and obviously would have preferred it if they had agreed to cooperate with his investigation.' Capper's dad, known to friends as Fred, has made a fortune from purchasing and selling luxury properties across the world. He has modernised and sold luxury villas in fortress estates like La Zagaleta near Marbella, home to some of the world's wealthiest people. Agnese's lawyer Fernando Scornick outside court (left).

An acquaintance, who asked not to be named, described him as 'mega-rich' and said he owned his own private plane with his name on the tail plate. He is currently understood to be based in Gibraltar. The source said: 'Westley might not look like a multi-millionaire's son but he's never wanted for anything.' Agnese's mum Daiga, in an appeal for information about her daugther's whereabouts in February, said: 'We can't believe this is happening. 'It has now been nearly six months without our daughter - not knowing if she is still alive or where she may be. 'Please help us find our Agnese, our lives will never be the same if we don't see her again.

A spokesman for the Find Agnese Klavina campaign said in a Facebook post: 'After seven months of waiting the secrecy of the case has finally been lifted by the Spanish authorities and as such the file of the case has been opened. 'We have had yesterday the spectacle of two of the accused men being 'interrogated' at court by the judge. 'Westley Capper and Craig Porter were repeatedly asked to answer questions relating to the case. 'They refused, citing their constitutional right to remain silent.

dbfed568d28e477d05e5af57d070c29501419df6,"It may come as a surprise to some - particularly Arsene Wenger and Pep Guardiola - but Jose Mourinho has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson inspired him to try to be a gracious manager. The Chelsea boss said in a wide-ranging interview with the Telegraph that the legendary Manchester United manager showed him 'two faces' during their first competitive meeting in 2004 - the first one of a steely rival and the second one of a sporting loser. Mourinho had just made his first impression on the Champions League by knocking out United with unfancied Porto. The Portuguese sprinted down the touchline at Old Trafford in an unforgettable celebration of Porto's last-gasp goal that sealed qualification and a seismic shock. Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho formed a firm friendship despite being fierce rivals . Fergie's Manchester United were stunned by Mourinho's Porto in the Champions League in 2004 . Mourinho sprinted down the touchline in celebration at Porto's last-gasp goal that sealed qualification . 'That was when I felt the two faces of such a big man,' said Mourinho. 'The first face was the competitor, the man that tried everything to win. And after that I found the man with principles, with the respect for the opponent, with the fair play – I found these two faces in that period, and that was very important for me. 'In my culture, the Portuguese and the Latin culture, we don’t have that culture of the second face; we are in football to win and when we don’t there is not a second face most of the time. But when we beat United in the Champions League I got that beautiful face of a manager which I try to have myself. I try.' Mourinho has attracted controversy like no other manager in the modern game. His many spats with Wenger have seen him form a bitter rivalry with the Arsenal boss, with Mourinho's accusation in 2005 that the Frenchman is like 'a voyeur' perhaps being the moment their relationship hit an all-time low, from which it has never recovered. Mourinho claims to have learned respect from Ferguson, but he has had many spats with Arsene Wenger . He also had a frosty relationship with Pep Guardiola when the pair were rival managers in Spain . The 52-year-old, who looks set to claim his third Barclays Premier League title with Chelsea this season, also formed a spiteful relationship with Guardiola while the pair duelled for honours in Spain. Arguably Mourinho's lowest moment came in gouging the eye of Guardiola's assistant, Tito Vilanova, in the closing stages of a Spanish Super Cup defeat for Real Madrid against Barcelona. After the match he referred to 'Pito' Vilanova - using the Spanish slang for penis. A less surprising Mourinho revelation is that he has no close friends in English football. 'Some, we like each other and have some communication, but I cannot say so close,' he said.","Jose Mourinho has spoken about his first meeting with Sir Alex Ferguson .

251bb9917a181bf47e21a7ae060fdcfe2c11f538,"Getting the best price for your unwanted wares online can seem like a fine art, but researchers have found a simple trick that could see your bids soar. Economists plotted how much goods listed on eBay sold for and discovered that items with precise prices attract higher offers than those with round numbers, such as $1,000. In fact, sellers who end their price with ‘00’ typically receive offers that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices. US researchers claim that exact prices of goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers. This chart shows that when the posted initial price is of a round number (the red dots), like $1,000, the average counteroffer is much lower than if it is a non-round number (the blue circles), like $1,079 . In terms of the study, the word 'odd' is used to represent an unusual number, and not the opposite of even. Competitive options for buyers and sellers can define a limit beyond which they will not go, but there is still a range of prices that fall within those limits, Professor of Strategic Management at University of Toronto, Joshua Gans, writes for The Conversation. Within that range, sellers are looking for a higher price while buyers would like a lower one, so each has an incentive to signal to the other their willingness to be a tough negotiator. Sometimes, however, sellers may want to send a signal they are willing to be less tough, such as when they are keen to sell an item quickly. One method is to lower their starting price, but this isn’t always desirable. Sellers on eBay who end their price with ‘00’ typically receive offers for their goods that are five to eight per cent lower than those with more specific prices, such as this watch example . While eBay is used for auctions, the bulk of its business comes from 'Buy it now' sales, such as this iPhone. The study found that prices that end in '00' as above are more likely to sell quickly, but may not attract the most lucrative counter offers from sellers . Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California, Berkeley, have addressed the problem in a new paper. Researchers from Cornell University, eBay Research Labs and the University of California looked at pricing strategies within the confines of eBay’s so-called 'negotiation platform'. Most trades on the site are listed for a  ‘Buy it now’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (£660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (£530). This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. The study found that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. Matt Backus, Thomas Blake and Steve Tadelis looked at this issue within the confines of eBay’s so-called 'negotiation platform'. While some people associate eBay with auctions rather than straightforward sales, this hasn’t been eBay’s main business for about a decade. Instead, most trades are listed for a  ‘Buy it now’ price and the seller can give buyers the option of making them an alternative offer. For example, a seller of an iPhone may list a price of $1,000 (£660), and someone might come back with a counteroffer of $800 (£530), to which the seller could then accept or make a new offer. This could go on for about three rounds, in line with eBay rules, and could last up to a week. But the study shows that when the initial price is a round number, such as $1,000, the average counteroffer is between five and eight per cent lower than if it is a non-round number, like $1,079. In fact, the economists said sellers can even end up with a higher counteroffer if they list at $997 rather than $1,000. ‘In other words, you are better off initially asking for a lower price if price was all you cared about,’ Professor Gans writes. The researchers believe that what is going on here is ‘cheap talk’ - an easy-to-make statement that may be true or untrue with no consequences for dishonesty - and not an otherwise reliable signal. There are some sellers who don’t just care about price and, absent any other way of signalling that to buyers, they set their price at a round number. The researchers applied their findings to house sales and discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they're willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price . While the study is new, Professor Gans said the technique to sell houses (a stock image is shown) as quickly as possible, or for as much money as possible, is already used by estate agents . Alternatively more patient sellers may be using non-round numbers to signal their toughness. Either way, the last two digits of the price is 'cheap talk'. But sellers with round numbers are more likely to close a deal six to 11 days sooner, and are up to 5 per cent more likely to sell at all. This is interesting because the last two digits of a price make little difference to the price, Professor Gans notes. The authors wanted to see if their analysis would work in other markets and whether they could guess what the cheap talk prices would be. They found was that while the effect they observed didn’t happen for all other prices, it did arise for prices that ended in 99 cents. Prices ending in 99 cents, or 99 pence, are very common in shops and send out the same type of signal as the ‘00’ prices, they said. The researchers also discovered that people looking to sell their house quickly should pick a round number, but if they are willing to wait, an odd one is more likely to get a good price – a trick estate agents already use.","Researchers claim using exact prices when selling goods on eBay attract higher offers than round numbers .
Sellers who end prices with ‘00’ typically receive offers up to 8% lower .
However, goods with round numbers typically sell faster, the study claims ."

The post by Lewis Helget, 27, appeared on Darren Goddard's timeline when he logged into the social networking site with the intention of deleting his account. A quarter of a century earlier, the 48-year-old had made the heartbreaking decision to leave behind his 18-month-old son, who he thought he would never see again. Finally reunited: Darren Goddard (right) finally met his son Lewis Helget, 27, last month after 25 years apart . Mr Goddard 'cried himself to sleep' when he parted ways with Lewis in 1989 after his marriage broke down following a horrific car accident. Just six years earlier, he had moved to Germany to pursue a career in the Army and met Lewis' mother Aggi, who he married two years later. Following his return to the UK from Germany, where he had been based as a soldier, he endured a 'real struggle' to move on with his life. He eventually came to terms with the fact he would never see his son again. Around three years ago, Mr Goddard's daughter Cally, 15, created a Facebook page for him. The former soldier never used the account and was about to delete it when Lewis' appeal turned up on his newsfeed. Happy ending: Former soldier Mr Goddard says his life is now 'complete' after seeing his 27-year-old son . Mr Goddard, of Basingstoke, Hants, said: 'Cally set me up with a Facebook account but I had no clue how to use it. 'I opened up my Facebook to shut it down and get rid of it and then Lewis was there and it said he had been looking for his father for four years. 'When I left the Army and came over here, I cried myself to sleep for two years. I knew his mum was a good mother and had lots of family so I was happy in the knowledge of that. 'But it still took me two years to get over the fact I was never going to see him again.' Lewis, who lives in Emsdetten in north west Germany, was finally reunited with his father in March. Mr Goddard made the first contact and the pair now speak to each other every day via Skype. They met at Stansted Airport last month as Lewis flew to the UK from Germany to attend his grandfather Ron's funeral - a man he never met. They spent a week together before Lewis returned to Germany on March 25 - and Mr Goddard says his life is now 'complete'. Troubled past: Mr Goddard's marriage to Lewis' mother ended after he was involved in a serious car accident which ended his career as a solider and led to him getting depression and leaving Germany . Describing how his marriage to Lewis' mother ended, the father-of-two spoke of the terrible injuries he suffered in a car accident. Following a year of agony, he was taken to a hospital near his Army base in Munster, Germany, to have an operation to remove a smashed disk in his back in 1988. It soon became clear he would not be able to carry out his Army duties and his career came to an abrupt end. Mr Goddard then began suffering from depression - which led to the breakdown of his marriage to Aggi. He added: 'Lewis has always been in my heart and I have never stopped thinking about him. 'When we met you wouldn't believe we have spent any time apart and we had our arms around each other and hugged. 'It has been so lovely and we have had the most fantastic week. He is a lovely man and is quite a bit like me.' Lewis said: 'It was very important for me to know my dad so that is why I came to England to meet him.'","Darren Goddard met first wife Aggi while based in Germany with the Army .

Twitter's top lawyer has admitted it has been ‘inexcusably slow’ in tackling online trolls who make the lives of others a misery. Vijaya Gadde said the social network had let internet abuse go ‘unchecked’ because it did not recognise the scope and scale of the problem. Miss Gadde said Twitter had tripled the size of the team that deals with online abuse – because it had to do better. She made the announcement on the day a study found that 88 per cent of abusive behaviour on social media happens on Twitter. Anti-bullying campaigners have also long complained that Twitter is a sanctuary for trolls who post hateful abuse behind the veil of anonymity. In an article for the Washington Post, Miss Gadde said that running Twitter required constant vigilance but that the company had ‘failed to live up to’ this aim. She admitted that ‘our response times have been inexcusably slow and the substance of our responses too meagre’. Miss Gadde wrote: ‘This is, to put it mildly, not good enough. ‘Freedom of expression means little as our underlying philosophy if we continue to allow voices to be silenced because they are afraid to speak up. We need to do a better job combating abuse without chilling or silencing speech’. Miss Gadde, general counsel for Twitter, said the extra staff the company had hired meant it was responding to five times as many complaints about abuse. The company was also making other changes ‘in ways that won’t be readily apparent’ to ensure its 284million users worldwide are safe.

55a1bb1ede8d88184c32116b1083ba836c96589b,"A 33-year-old woman on trial for having sex with a male inmate at Washington County Jail six times over four months while working as a services technician cried in court Wednesday as a judge rejected her request to use an insanity defense. Brett Robinson will now stand trial next week on 12 charges related to sexual misconduct and official misconduct, on allegations that she let the inmate out of his cell multiple times and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year. Robinson was hoping to present a psychologists report as evidence of mental disease or defect. The report said she was suffering from mental illness at the time of the alleged encounters and that it made her  'vulnerable, passive and gullible'. However at a motion hearing, Circuit Judge Andrew Erwin ruled the evidence was insufficient and that Robinson would have to go to trial on April 28 without it. The judge went in favor of the prosecution, who said the report should have been filed as evidence last year if the defense were going to argue insanity. Defense denied: A judge ruled Wednesday that attorneys for Brett Robinson, 33, waited too long to file an insanity defense, ruling evidence that she was suffering from mental illness when she engaged in sex acts with a prison inmate last year as insufficient . Charged: Robinson allegedly brought the male inmate into the control where she worked at Washing County Jail and had sex with him on his birthday under a blanket . State law says that defendants should file notice regarding evidence of mental disease or defect when they plead not guilty, Oregon Live reported. The judge said the defense filing it on April 10 was 'untimely' and that he didn't want to delay the trial. The case follows that of her colleague Lisa Curry, 39, who last month was sentenced to over four years prison for repeatedly having sex with a 25-year-old gang member and convicted rapist. Robinson, who worked in a maximum security control room known as 'the bubble', struck up a relationship with the inmate - who has not been named -  in a nearby cell. The two would talk using an intercom when Robinson's manager left the room. According to the psychologist's report obtained by   Robinson felt flattered by the compliments she got from the inmate and started to 'open up to him' early last year.Then, in March, the inmate asked for a kiss on his birthday. When her manager went to lunch, Robinson released the inmate from his cell and brought him into the bubble. She thought it strange that he brought a blanket with him from the cell, the report said. 'He kissed me so passionately, I was taken aback. 'I asked about the blanket. 'He said ''I was hoping we could go farther''. 'Then he was saying ''we don't have time to discuss this'', so I had sex with him.' New protocol: In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again . On trial: Brett Robinson, 33, faces charges of first-degree custodial sexual misconduct and first-degree official misconduct . They continued having sexual encounters, the report said, and Robinson wrote the inmate a love letter that began with 'Hi Baby'. The letter said: 'I am hoping this letter will better convey the love I feel deep inside for you. ... You are a constant presence in my thoughts, fantasies and dreams, and I feel this pervasive emptiness without you by my side. It makes it hard to go about my normal daily activities when all I do is miss you. You are my everything, Baby – I could not envision my life without you in it.' However the relationship began to sour when Robinson started hearing about the abusive conduct of the inmate elsewhere in the prison. He had passed a sexually explicit note to a nurse and also pushed a female prisoner against a wall and kissed her. The psychologist noted that Robinson was delusional about the man. The report also said she had struggled with depression and anxiety since childhood. 'There is evidence that these delusions developed in this generally vulnerable, passive and gullible woman as part of a Major Depressive and Anxiety episode,' the doctor wrote. Robinson was caught when the inmate brought up their relationship to a prison employee during an investigation about Jill Curry. The prosecution is fighting against Robinson using the insanity defense. In March Curry was sentenced to four years and two months prison. That case was very similar to the allegations against Robinson. Curry was also a services technician and was convicted of letting gang member Jang-Li Delgado Galban, 25,  who was housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, out of his cell and have sex with him in a supply closet. Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cries in court last month as she was sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with an inmate in a supply closet . Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian. Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in the supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose. Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation when sentencing Curry. The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician. Curry had claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her . Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation. She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center. An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her. The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped. In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release. But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry. In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again.","Brett Robinson, 33, facing 12 charges after allegedly letting an inmate out of his cell and engaging in sex acts between March and July last year .

7591673bf0c43fff729266f85152a5b299c795e6,"College basketball player Lauren Hill lost her battle with cancer on Friday morning, aged just 19. The Indiana native, who was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer shortly after her 18th birthday, had defied doctors' expectations after they told her that she would not live past December. Instead, she played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer, Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. But as her condition worsened, she became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital, where she passed away on Friday morning. Scroll down for video . Loss: Lauren Hill, who is pictured playing for Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati in November, died in hospital on Friday - aged just 19 - after a brave battle with a rare form of brain cancer . Just a year and a half ago, Hill was just another high school student getting ready for college after she decided to play basketball at Mount St. Joseph. A few weeks later, she started experiencing dizziness while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found the tumor and she was told that she had less than two years left. But in September, doctors told her she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout high school basketball player, Hill's hopes of playing college ball were put in jeopardy. But the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition, and on November 2, she realized her dream of playing for the school. She scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. 'It's a dream come true,' she said. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013 and right in December 2014 after her treatment for Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma, a rare childhood brain cancer, changed her appearance . Brave: Hill, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December . Final days: Lauren is pictured enjoying Easter and St Patrick's Day from hospital in Cincinnati . At the game, she said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game, USA Today reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Hill played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four. Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, her family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.' The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. Fighter: The NCAA moved the school's first game forward last November (pictured) so that Lauren could achieve her dream of playing for collegiate basketball. She scored the first and last baskets . Heroic: Hill, left, smiles at Pat Summitt after receiving the Pat Summitt Award during halftime of her first NCAA college basketball game in November last year. She went on to play four games for the school . 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' her coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.' No information about a memorial has yet been released but Lawrenceburg Schools superintendent Karl Galey said on Twitter that schools will be prepared to assist staff and students with counseling.","Hill was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer when she was 18 and by last September, she was told she would not live past December .

e7934ef50bcc54740e770c7fe70a0f856a657b06,"Hong Kong (CNN)Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are two dynamic leaders at the helm of the world's two most populous nations. And one is particularly vocal about making his mark on history. When India successfully placed a spacecraft into orbit around Mars last year, Modi reveled in the moment. ""History has been created today,"" he said. ""We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible. ""The success of our space program is a shining symbol of what we are capable of as a nation."" Soon after the galactic feat, he took to the stage at New York's famous Madison Square Garden and received a welcome so rapturous that Jon Stewart called him ""America's First Modi."" And all along, Modi has issued his call to ""Make in India,"" encouraging companies all over the world to manufacture their products in India where there is a vast talent pool and low-cost production. While Modi's India is out to put its economy on the fast track, China's economy is slowing after over 25 years of breakneck growth. President Xi is managing the slowdown with efforts to boost domestic spending, while cracking down hard on corruption. And it's been predicted that India could outpace China as the world's fastest growing economy as soon as this year. So is the world's largest democracy primed to overtake the world's biggest single party state as the next economic miracle? OPINION: What India can learn from China . Not so fast, says China watcher and India Today correspondent Ananth Krishnan. ""China is still pulling away from India,"" the Beijing-based reporter said. ""If India grows 7.5% this year and China grows 7.4%, I think it makes a good headline.  But I think people shouldn't get carried away about what it means in terms of a gap between China and India."" China's economy may be slowing down but India faces a longer list of economic challenges including higher unemployment, chronic inflation and an overwhelming lack of basic infrastructure. ""In terms of education, having access to different resources, and job creation, China has done well. It has progressed far better compared to India,"" said Infosys China CEO Rangarajan R. Vellamore. ""Even though there is free movement across the country (in India), the paradox is there are a lot of basic issues related to access to water and basic education."" In a recent budget, the Modi government announced plans to boost infrastructure spending as well as cut taxes on businesses among other initiatives to spur economic growth. But despite Modi's big pro-business push, India simply can't size up against China's raw economic might. ""After 30 years of dedicated efforts in building China into a manufacturing powerhouse, it would take a long time for India to build that kind of manufacturing capability,"" said Haiyan Wang, Managing Partner of the China India Institute. ""It's not just about lower labor costs. You have to have a complex industry cluster of supply chains. You have to have the knowledge. You have to have the skills. You have to be connected to the international market,"" she said. ""So when you ask if India could compete with China, I don't think that is going to be happening -- not in the next 20 years."" The Indian elephant may be charging ahead, but the sinewy dragon has the muscle to stay ahead. China has the capacity, the connectivity, and the capital to throw its weight around. And being a single party state with no free elections, Xi can march toward a long-term goal without fretting about the next election. But that's not to say the autocracy has the advantage on all fronts, especially when it comes to winning hearts and minds in the region. ""Even if China is putting money into the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Silk Road fund, it is also building airstrips on reclaimed islands on the South China Sea,"" said Krishnan. ""There no question that India's rise is far less threatening than China's rise."" With the 1962 border dispute still vividly remembered by many in India, the impression of China as a threat stands in the way of further economic integration between the two countries. ""If you look at India's seven northeastern states, which are probably in the most dire need of infrastructure, it's inconceivable for any of those states to allow a Chinese company to come and build roads,"" said Krishnan. So when Modi touches down in Beijing next month for his second meeting with Xi, can both leaders cast aside areas of political tension to get down to business? ""As pragmatic as President Xi is, as pragmatic as Prime Minister Modi is, economic integration is going to happen regardless of 100% trust or not,"" said Haiyan Wang. Eased by the pragmatism of two ambitious leaders, the elephant and the dragon could together leap at the opportunity for a strong economic alliance. ""If these two countries come together, 40% of the world's people are going to be prosperous,"" said Vellamore. ""If they are able to come together, there can be a new kind of world order in the entire region which is going to benefit all of Asia."" It's a moment for both leaders to make a lasting mark on history.","India predicted to outpace China as as world's fastest-growing economy in next year .

In the case of late 19th-century America, it was the 'escort card' - not to be confused with the explicit sort you might imagine today - but rather a comical printed card men would hand to women they found attractive. Collector Alan Mays has unearthed a treasure trove of these vintage ice-breakers, which bear phrases such as: 'May I be permitted the blissful pleasure of escorting you home this evening?' Scroll down for video . Long before mobile phones came along - allowing single men and women to flirt behind the comfort of a glowing screen - shy love-seekers of the late 19th Century had to resort to other tactics (pictured) These comical printed cards were handed out by men  to women they found attractive . According to The Encyclopedia of Ephemera, there were two types of cards used in the 1870s and 1880s. One was referred to as the 'calling card' and would be used by gentleman to formally introduce themselves to new acquaintances - much like the modern business card. The second, as seen in Mr Mays' collection, was a novelty variety reserved for more casual encounters, namely men seeking the company of women, known as an 'escort card'. 'The device commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration,' the encyclopaedia states. 'Flirtatious and fun, the acquaintance card brought levity to what otherwise might have seemed a more formal proposal. 'A common means of introduction, it was never taken too seriously.' MessyNessyChic uncovered the collection, calling them an array of 'amusing pick-up lines you’ve not likely heard before while waiting for your drink at the bar'. Rhyming couplets appeared to have been rather popular  in the 19th century according to these cards . The card commonly carried a brief message and a simple illustration . Some were quite specific in their nature - albeit in a very polite way . Many of them have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern-day pick-up line. 'Dear Miss: You are sensible and good, you have all the charms of womanhood, your eyes resemble the stars above you, I shall be miserable if I can't love you,' reads one. 'May I see you home? Or will I have to set on the fence and watch you meander by?' reads another. Some were a little more down-to-business. 'I very much desire to make your acquaintance. If agreeable, please return this card, appointing time and place for interview, on the other side,' reads one. Another even blunter card bears the question: 'I am _ who the devil are you?' Several of the cards bear phrases such as: 'May I have the pleasure of seeing you home this evening? If so, keep this card; if not, please return.' Practical, if nothing else. Certain cards were short and to-the-point - including this 'may I. C. U. Home?' card . These 'escort cards' were seen as a more casual version of what we today regard as business cards . This blank card poses, 'Who the devil are you?' This man's intent is made crystal clear by its very title . Many of the cards have all the flowery but insincere charm of a cheesy modern-day pick-up line . 'Two souls with but a single thought; two hearts that beat as one', reads this one . This card addresses its recipient as a 'dear creature' Many carried the disclaimer, 'If so, keep this card, if not, please return it'","The cheeky cards were given by men to women in 19th century America .

43f44ff85343331d11f4d4952a3ebbde6584c570,"THE WILD OATS PROJECT . by Robin Rinaldi . (Hodder £14.99) At the age of 42, San Francisco-based journalist Robin Rinaldi believed she had accidentally succeeded in conceiving a longed- for child. The pregnancy test turned out to be wrong, but her husband Scott wasn’t taking any more chances: he got a vasectomy. Rinaldi’s response was to demand an open marriage and bed 12 strangers in as many months. She’s now written a graphic, tell-all memoir about that year and its very messy fallout. Robin Rinaldi (pictured) demanded an open marriage from her husband, Scott after he had a vasectomy . When they met, 17 years earlier, Rinaldi wasn’t sure she wanted kids. As her biological clock began ticking louder, though, a child came to embody the solution to all sorts of problems. It would strengthen their marriage of opposites, help her finally overcome a troubled childhood as the daughter of an alcoholic bookie and give her life a sense of purpose. Her husband, meanwhile, was adamantly against it from the start. For reasons she never quite gets to the bottom of, he has no desire ever to become a father. She depicts him as stable and stoic but, frankly, he sounds a bit of a cold fish, spending much of his spare time making mead, keeping a file on his laptop entitled My World View and refusing to look her in the eye during sex. After his vasectomy, Rinaldi’s discontent settles onto her failure to sleep around when she was single. ‘I refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers,’ she declares. ‘If I can’t have one, I must have the other.’ Promiscuity, she’s certain, will enable her to look back from her deathbed and feel she’s lived. Instead of ending her marriage, she strikes a bargain that seems to give her the best of both worlds. During the week, Rinaldi lives in a rented studio, free to have as much casual sex as she likes. She picks up men on business trips, places ‘good girl seeks experience’ ads online and, eventually, gravitates to an urban sex commune, where very hands-on orgasmic meditation is practised twice daily. Come the weekend, she returns to Scott and their cat Cleo — no questions asked. Reading about her Wild Oats Project, it’s hard to know what’s more astonishing — that Scott ever agreed to this 5:2 open marriage or that Rinaldi thought it could possibly solve anything. Full disclosure: some years ago, I published a memoir about my own year-long experiment — with chastity. Afterwards, several people told me I should write a follow-up in which I did the exact opposite. I assumed they were joking, but that’s more or less precisely what Rinaldi has done. Not that it isn’t titillating stuff — at least to begin with. What she craves most especially is dirty talk, and she gives as good as she gets. There’s no hint of coyness as she details every sexual act she participates in along the way. As it gets steamier, her prose flushes a deep purple. There’s also some truly terrible dialogue. ‘Hmmm,’ she says, after being given technique tips by a 23-year-old she’s just slept with. ‘Roger that.’ Reading about another person’s orgasms turns out to be just as dull as flipping through their dream journal. Of her 12 partners, most are younger and two are women, one of whom agrees to a threesome. Yet they soon start to merge. This is California, and every other lover seems to be a vegan or a healer or a vegan healer. They strum her songs they’ve written as she fries them soya sausages. Only one of them really gets to her. Alden is a writer in his late-30s. They meet online and quickly tumble into bed. ‘In his sheets, I uncovered women who had lain dormant in me for years,’ she trills. He tells her she’s a goddess and that he worships her — until he ends it, abruptly. Later, when Rinaldi’s year is up and she finds herself back living full-time with Scott, trying to patch up their — you guessed it — deeply fractured intimacy, it’s an email from Alden that finally derails everything. As more women cross childless into middle-age, there’s undoubtedly a book to be written about their journey. This is not it. In fact, Rinaldi seems able to define herself solely in relation to her fertility and her allure to men. So much for her feminism. To be fair, it isn’t entirely devoid of self-criticism. Narcissistic, naïve, unfair: these are all words she applies to herself at various moments. But, in addition to being myopically self-absorbed, this is also a sad book. By the time you reach the end, any gains she’s made are balanced by some considerable losses. And then there’s the book’s dedication. To Ruby, it reads — Ruby being the name she planned to give the child she’s now unlikely ever to have.","Aged 42 Robin Rinaldi believed she had conceived a longed-for child .

d3616dcb901cb3016bf83f69e57baf7d558cd12d,"Women paid 62p an hour in Mauritius to make ‘feminist’ T-shirts have been beaten by police during protests over pay and conditions at their ‘sweatshop’ factory. Dozens of workers at the factory – exposed by The Mail on Sunday for its low wages and prison-like accommodation for women making the ‘This Is What A Feminist Looks Like’ T-shirts – have been sacked and deported for staging what bosses called ‘an illegal strike’. At the end of a peaceful three-day protest, Bangladeshi migrant workers – who produce clothes for Whistles, Topshop and Next – were surrounded by officers who charged at them, hitting out with batons, before dragging the screaming women away. Scroll down for video . Beaten: Workers were treated roughly by police during protests over pay and conditions at their ‘sweatshop’ factory . As many as 1,800 workers at the Compagnie Mauricienne de Textile (CMT) factory went on strike last week about their pay, harsh treatment, food and concerns about a missing worker. Now 69 of the women have been deported to Bangladesh and scores more now fear for their jobs. Whistles, in partnership with feminist charity The Fawcett Society and Elle magazine, enlisted the factory to make the £45 T-shirts last year and they were proudly worn by Labour leader Ed Miliband, his deputy Harriet Harman and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. After this newspaper revealed the female workers’ poor pay and living conditions – they sleep 16 to a room – Whistles and The Fawcett Society defended the factory, claiming it conformed to ‘ethical standards’. Exposed: The 62p-an-hour factory where 'This is what a feminist looks like' T-shirt was made . But last night, Whistles and Topshop announced investigations, while Next cancelled its orders from the factory. A Labour spokesman condemned the violence. One Bangladeshi worker, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said: ‘Police charged at us, beating us with sticks. We started screaming and running. They hit us and dragged some of the women away. I’m really scared I’ll be deported as well. If I lose my job, my family will be ruined.’ Fighting back tears, she lifted the lid on life inside the factory, revealing that employees were told by bosses to lie to auditors about their working conditions or face being sacked. She said they are often forced to work from 7.30am until 11pm to meet unreasonable targets of making 300 garments a day. She added that the women, who work six-day weeks, are not paid for all of their overtime. The strike was sparked after factory worker Nazma Aktear went missing on March 26 following a hospital visit. Her colleagues grew increasingly worried when bosses failed to provide information about her whereabouts. They downed tools on Tuesday. The day after, as protests escalated, police and government ministers ordered the employees back to work. A dedicated band of 200 women continued the strike on Thursday despite Miss Aktear being found. Bosses paraded a frail Miss Aktear in front of the protesters and repeated orders for them to return to work. But the workers, who receive less than the island’s living wage, refused and the violence ensued. Unrest: A striker is led away by police at the Mauritius factory amid unrest of pay and conditions . Violence: Dozens of workers at the factory have been sacked and deported following the strike at the Mauritius factory where police are accused of brutality . Following our exposé in November, Next met with factory bosses and ‘identified a number of specific shortcomings that required addressing by CMT’ and last week it carried out another inspection and found ‘there are still some outstanding areas of concern’. It has now cancelled its most recent order and future orders pending an inquiry. A Whistles spokesman said: ‘We are deeply concerned by reports of recent events concerning the CMT factory. We are investigating these allegations as a matter of urgency.’ A spokeswoman for Topshop owner Arcadia said: ‘We have started a full and detailed investigation into the reported incident.’ A spokesman for Miliband and Harman said the T-shirts were ‘a campaign run by Elle and The Fawcett Society to promote feminism and we were happy to support it’. Elle, The Fawcett Society and CMT refused to comment.","Women beaten by police during protests over pay and conditions .

Experts say snacking is an important way to control hunger; and while we would like to think we reach for something healthy like carrot sticks, raisins or a handful of almonds, more often than not it's salty crisps, sweet biscuits or cheap chocolate that we tend to munch on. But why exactly do we snack? And if we knew what the triggers were, would we be able to stop ourselves from reaching for unhealthy foods? Scroll down for video . We're all guilty of snacking, but there are some who do it more often than others . Femail has worked with dietitian Lucy Jones from The Almond Board of California to study snacking habits in the UK and identified three tribes of snackers: Snack Amnesiacs, Situational Snackers and Super Snackers. Ms Jones's research has revealed the habits which lead us to nibble needlessly, identifying the behaviours and reasons behind these three distinct snack tribes: . Ms Jones told Femail: 'Snack Amnesiacs are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack, opening something and eating far more than they intended. 'More often than not, these snackers have no concept of what or how much they are eating. According to Ms Jones, those who are stressed out due to environmental or emotional pressures are Situational Snackers. This tribe often have busy schedules which causes them to skip meals. Then there are the Super Snackers. 'They are the snack savvy, who recognise energy lows and tummy grumbles and plan ahead. This tribe only nibble sensibly, as and when their body tells them to,' Ms Jones said. Ms Jones is encouraging women to revamp their snacking habits by trying the 21 Day Snack Happy challenge: a simply snack on a handful of almonds once a day for 21 days. 'Snacking is important to help control hunger and provide essential nutrients. We all lead such busy lives and juggle a variety of tasks and commitments every day, often resulting in long gaps between meals. 'The Snack Happy Challenge works well because 21 days is the length of time it takes to form a habit, or swap a bad habit for a good one. Planning ahead and arming yourself with a handful of almonds will really help to get you through the day.' 'As a high source of fibre and containing 15 essential nutrients, almonds are the perfect snack you can feel good about,' she said. Take our quiz to find out just what sort of snacker you are and how to change your bad habits. 1. Do you ever find yourself picking up food for comfort? If you answered yes go to Question 3. If you answered no go to Question 2. 2. Do you feel like you are aware of your snacking habits? If you answered yes go to Question 5. If you answered no go to Question 4. 3. Do you often find yourself reaching for whatever foods are nearest to hand in order to keep your hunger pangs at bay? If you answered yes go to Question 6. If you answered no go to Question 4. 4. Do you regularly plan out your nutrient intake in advance, even on busy days? If you answered yes go to Question 8. If you answered no go to Question 6. 5. When you’re having a busy day, can you usually stay strong and avoid snacking on things you feel are bad for you? If you answered no go to Question 4. If you answered yes go to Question 8. 6. Does your busy schedule often mean you have no time to prepare and eat a full lunch? If you answered Yes you are a Situational Snacker. If you answered no go Go Question 7. 7. Do you often find yourself opening a packet of biscuits only meaning to eat one, but suddenly find the packet is empty? If you answered yes you are a Snack Amnesiac. If you answered no you are a Super Snacker. 8. If you were asked to remember everything you’d nibbled on throughout the day, would you remember every mouthful? If you answered Yes you are a Super Snacker. If you answered no go to question 7. _____________________________________________________________________________ . If you are a Situational Snacker: . The Situational Snacker is a very busy bee and often doesn't have the time to prepare and eat a full meal during her day. To fill up, the situational snacker will grab snacks throughout the day, whilst she can. Nibbling on the children's packed lunch leftovers for breakfast whilst she chops up the carrots, snacking in the car for lunch after doing the food shop, or quickly scoffing half a sandwich before the company meeting is common for this type of snacker. If you're a 'Situational Snacker' you might find that emotional pressures, stress and a particularly busy day can cause you to snack, even if not hungry, and you may be particularly prone to pick at food as a comfort mechanism. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Almost three quarters (73 per cent) of women in the UK said that stress lead them to overlook their nutrient intake. This is an issue I often see, and it can have a serious impact on health. If women aren't dedicating time to their diet and thinking carefully about their nutrient intake, they could be at risk of over or under eating. 'The key is to snack sensibly and make sure you have something nutritious to nibble on at your desk, in the kitchen, in the car, or wherever the hunger pangs strike. The nutrients in almonds make them a perfect snack to enjoy between meals. Almonds are also a high source of magnesium, which contributes to a reduction of tiredness and fatigue, so they really are the perfect snack to keep you going through a busy day.' If you are a Snack-Amnesiac: . Throughout her day, the Snack-Amnesiac will graze on the foods closest to hand, without even realising she's doing it. Munching through a share-size bag of crisps whilst watching the telly when she only meant to eat a handful, reaching for the plate of biscuits during a lull in the board meeting and even waking up in the middle of the night and sleepwalking to the kitchen to nibble on some leftovers from the fridge are just a few examples of the mindless snacking habit in action. Do you find yourself opening a packet of biscuits only meaning to eat one, but suddenly the packet is empty? If you were asked to remember everything you'd nibbled on throughout the day, would you remember every mouthful? If you find yourself snacking on food without even realising, you could well be a Snack-Amnesiac and you're not alone – research commissioned by the Almond Board of California has shown that 90 per cent of women in the UK admit to snacking mindlessly throughout the day. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Research has shown that women are typically lacking in fibre and often eat higher levels of the daily recommended allowance of saturated fat. 'With 90 per cent of women suspected of suffering from Snack-Amnesia1 and eating anything close to hand without taking the nutrient content into account, it isn't difficult to see how diets become unbalanced. However, if you are a 'Snack Amnesiac,' there are easy ways you can ensure you're still achieving a balanced diet. Almonds are a high source of fibre and just a handful (approximately 30g or 23 almonds) a day can boost your nutrient intake. These great little nuts are also high in unsaturated fat, and in fact, a recent study published in the European Journal of Nutrition found that a mid-morning snack of almonds helped control appetite and resulted in reduced calorie intake by the participants during the rest of the day. If Snack-Amnesiacs keep a handful of almonds close by, this could help to curb the cravings and the mindless munching later in the day. If you are a Super Snacker: . The Super Snacker is a woman who is well aware of her snacking habits and despite a busy day, or the odd sweet craving, she'll do what she can to stay strong and find the foods she needs to help get her through – no matter what the day might bring. Busy day of meetings and no time for lunch – the super snacker will ensure she's got a steady supply of her favourite nutritional snacks pre-packed and close to hand to see her through. Prone to an afternoon lull – the Super Snacker will have a nutritious pick-me up ready to go. Craving an evening treat after a long day – the Super Snacker will reach for a snack from the well-stocked healthy snack jar. Do you pack a snack in your handbag each day? Are you familiar with the times of day that you need an extra boost? If so, like one in five women in the UK, you could be a Super Snacker. Lucy Jones' advice: 'Well-balanced snacking is a great way to stay on top of your hunger pangs and ensure a daily dose of the nutrients that your body needs. But healthy and happy snacking needn't be difficult or dull. 'As most Super Snackers know, there are some simple tricks to help adopt happy snacking habits. Mixing up different textures and flavours adds variety to your daily food intake. 'Pack a punch with a nutritiously crunchy handful of almonds added to some mango for sweetness, or even dark chocolate for a more indulgent snack.'","Snack amnesiacs are mindless munchers who subconsciously snack .

Peter Tait, the headmaster of Sherborne Preparatory School in Dorset, claimed parents have become 'dervishes' about their children's education and should take a back seat to allow them to develop naturally. Writing in Attain, the magazine for the Independent Association of Prep Schools, Mr Tait said the modern trend of interfering stemmed from parents being bombarded with information about how to raise a child. Parents need to keep their distance and use their intuition to trust schools and teachers, a leading head teacher has claimed. Stock image used . Mr Tait warned that while parents naturally wanted the very best for their children, such interference could end up hindering their natural development, The Daily Telegraph reported. He said: 'What has made some parents put their own child at the centre of the universe and to hell with the rest?' Adding that parents must trust those responsible for their children's education, he added: 'To do this requires a certain detachment, a willingness to trust the passage of time, focusing on whether their children are happy, challenged and purposeful and are learning the right values.' Sherborne, which was founded in 1550 by Edward VI in the Dorset village of the same name, has educated prominent churchmen and army generals, as well as famous figures such as codebreaker Alan Turing and Downton Abbey actor Hugh Bonneville and Coldplay singer Chris Martin. The school has enjoyed strong academic performance recently. On A-Level results day it was announced that 40 per cent of all grades were A*s or As, with six boys meeting offers to study at Oxford or Cambridge. The phenomenon of parents placing their children before any others and pushes their children to high levels of achievement through a range of after-school activities has been termed Tiger Parenting. Last year, Gail Larkin, the president of the National Association of Head Teachers, also attacked parents saying that some children were being forced to sit through hours of unnecessary tuition by pushy parents competing with one another. She added that instead of two or three hours spent in more classes after school, children would benefit from joining a swimming club, taking up ballet, or playing in the park instead. Mr Tait is Headmaster of Sherborne Preparatory School (pictured) in Dorset, who has been writing in Attain magazine . She also took a swipe at parents, saying part of the drive for extra tuition was down to adults being unwilling to help their children with homework. Meanwhile a survey, by teachers' union NASUWT, revealed a disturbing picture of how parents are increasingly using Facebook and Twitter to intimidate staff. It showed families are using social media to post obscenities, threats, offensive photos, sexually explicit insults and even covert films of teachers - with 30 per cent of those polled confirming they had been the subject of parents' abusive internet posts. The poll of 1,500 teachers also showed that the proportion of teachers suffering abuse from both parents and pupils has more than doubled over the past year – increasing from 21 per cent to 60 per cent. NASUWT general secretary Chris Keates said: 'It is deeply worrying to see that the abuse of teachers has risen by such a huge margin this year. 'Equally concerning is that it appears that more parents are the perpetrators of the abuse.' He added: 'The vile, insulting and personal comments are taking their toll on teachers' health and wellbeing and undermining their confidence to do their job.'","Headmaster Peter Tait claimed parents should trust their child's educators .

b7c69c875b5e4111d8c950d6217cb4bf331fdc5b,"Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola blamed his team's Champions League quarter-final first-leg defeat by Porto on injuries. Porto take a two-goal advantage to Munich next Tuesday for the return leg of the last-eight clash after punishing a sloppy Bayern with two early goals from Ricardo Quaresma and a second-half effort from Jackson Martinez. Guardiola said: 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries ... their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Pep Guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad . Porto manager Julen Lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals, but they will need to be 'perfect' in the second leg. 'Now we have produced a situation for ourselves where we can dream, knowing that we will need to give everything we have got to get through,' Lopetegui, a former Barcelona team mate of Guardiola, told reporters. 'We will need to produce a perfect performance in Germany next week to progress.' Julen Lopetegui says reaching the Champions League semi-final would be a dream come true . Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch . Lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer Martinez, who had been out since early March with a hamstring problem, was one of the reasons for Wednesday's victory. 'With him back in the attack, we were able to press Bayern with some force and give them real problems,' he said. Martinez, who capitalised on an error by Jerome Boateng in the 65th minute to round Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer for Porto's third goal after Thiago Alcantara had reduced the arrears, said he was not yet 100 percent fit. The striker was a constant menace for Bayern's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed Xabi Alonso before being brought down by Neuer for a penalty that Quaresma converted. Jackson Martinez (right) rounds Neuer to slot home Porto's third goal and put them in control . Martinez troubled Bayern throughout and tackled Xabi Alonso (right) in the build up to the penalty . It was a similar story for Porto's second goal when Quaresma picked the pocket of Dante before beating Neuer with a clever finish on 10 minutes. 'It was fundamental that we tried our best to impose ourselves on Bayern and not give them a chance to settle,' Martinez said. Quaresma also sought to heap praise on Porto's team ethic, saying hard work had proved the difference between the two teams. 'There are no stars here. We all work hard for our results,' the forward said. 'The win is more important to us than the display. We have all worked extremely hard to get this win to give ourselves something to defend in the second leg.'

'As long as I feel valued, I will continue here,' he told El Mundo. 'Although you never know what the future will bring in football. The Spaniard did say that his continuing at the club would depend on him still feeling valued by Arsenal . 'I live in Hampstead, 15 minutes from the training ground, and it's really nice. 'It's the perfect place for my kids to go to school... very calm.

965fda5a9dc6a38359f7809070bf6397266689ac,"Britain's biggest banks earmarked billions of pounds for 'remediation costs' and fines over the last three years . Britain's biggest banks have racked up a £39billion bill in just three years to pay for their financial scandals. ‘Remediation costs’ wiped out 61 per cent of their profits between 2011 and 2014, according to accountants KPMG. The bill has been driven by the payment protection insurance scandal, with banks setting aside £4.7billion last year to compensate customers. Another £2.3billion was earmarked by banks including Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC to pay fines for rigging foreign exchange markets. The total charge for wrongdoing last year – £9.9billion – was only 8 per cent less than the previous year. Describing it as a ‘problem that won’t go away’, KPMG said banks also face mounting costs from employing an army of compliance staff to keep them out of trouble. RBS is thought to be facing a multibillion-pound settlement in the US for mis-selling toxic bundles of mortgage debt – known as mortgage-backed securities – in the run up to the financial crisis. Barclays is also braced for a huge fine for rigging foreign exchange rates, having put aside £1.25billion so far to cover the bill. But the UK’s strengthening economy has driven a 72 per cent drop in losses from bad loans, with write-offs falling to £5.2billion last year. RBS was boosted by £1.4billion after not as many loans went sour as it had feared. This compares with an £8.1billion charge in 2013. So-called ‘impairment charges’ at Lloyds fell £2billion to £752million as the improving economy meant fewer retail customers and businesses defaulted on their repayments. Scroll down for video . This translated into a surge in the bottom line, with Lloyds posting a £1.8billion profit, up from £415million in 2013. RBS’s losses narrowed to £3.5billion last year from £8.2billion in 2013. Barclays, HSBC and Standard Chartered all saw profits fall. KPMG said banks must ‘urgently tackle’ their low return on equity – a key measure of shareholder value – and need to invest in technology to increase their profits. Tougher regulations forcing them to hold more capital have made it more expensive for them to do business, especially in higher-risk areas. Banks including RBS and Barclays have responded by shrinking their investment banking arms. KPMG’s Bill Michael said: ‘Banks are undergoing a once in a lifetime change, as they face evolving regulation, technology and society’s expectations … If further regulation creates too many strictures on non-retail banking, the industry risks losing its global relevance.’ KPMG said banks must ‘urgently tackle’ their low return on equity and need to invest in technology to increase their profits.","Britain's banks set aside £4.7billion last year in PPI compensation last year .

The images were taken in Jervis Bay, the south coast of NSW, as the neon glow illuminated one of Australia's popular beaches. Photographer Andy Hutchinson described the sight as a 'beautiful supernatural scene' caused by millions of plankton omitting light. A similar display was shown in Sydney's Manly Beach back in August 2014 where an oceanography expert told Daily Mail Australia there was no need to be concerned about the algae. 'The glow is caused by Noctiluca scintillans, which is a single celled phytoplankton - the algae of the sea - which blossoms in the spring and the autumn and in 90 per cent of occasions occurs due to natural causes,' Iain Suthers, of University of New South Wales, said. Mr Suthers explained that the bizarre carnivorous cell, which preys on another type of algae called diatoms, gives off the luminous glow as a defence mechanism. Scroll down for video .

84bdd724457a4c2161844fb4ff91fefa5465e9aa,"Jeremy Scott’s spring/summer 2015 collection for Moschino caused an Insta-stampede, nearly breaking the internet when he sent human Barbie dolls down the catwalk. The creative head, who is famed for making kitsch cool, sent his models down the runway in Milan in Barbie doll inspired dresses to the sound of Aqua's iconic 90s hit, I'm A Barbie Girl. As the ultimate dictator of trends, it seems that we may all be wearing bright pink leathers and super girly dresses this season. But does the look work in real life? And will you garner attention for the right reasons?  Weighed down by eyelashes, Olivia Phillips, 30, a journalist at Emirates Woman, decided to find out by taking to the streets of Dubai dressed like the iconic doll. Here's how she got on... Scroll down for video . If Moschino's latest collection is anything to go by, Barbie will be our style icon this season. Weighed down by eyelashes, Olivia Phillips took to the streets (and supermarkets) of Dubai dressed as the iconic doll . I’m like a vampire Barbie; I only come out at night. Daylight hours, on the other hand, are a very different story, with me championing a pretty consistent, low-fi uniform of skinny jeans, biker jackets and a scruffy bun. My nocturnal counterpart, however, stands in almost unrecognisable contrast; her heels are high and her hair even higher. So although donning Jeremy Scott’s Barbie-inspired Moschino collection wasn’t as much of an almighty leap for me as it would be for, say, the rest of the world, it still required a certain amount of chutzpah to take it to the streets. Still,  I located my audacity and got out there to see exactly how the looks would translate to real life. It only took one Google search to reveal exactly how popular Barbie still is - but a far more entertaining barometer was watching the office’s reaction when a giant box from Moschino arrived at my desk. With the same fervour usually reserved for a Magnolia delivery, I was suddenly surrounded by a cluster of excited, giggling women on the edge. Olivia explained that literally everyone smiled at her. Doors opened for her, small animals and children stared, she got a hand with her shopping and a wink with her Starbucks . Olivia wore the spray-on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop. Navigating the supermarket aisles, she admits she felt like a saucy Stepford Wife . Everyone had a story to share – from the doll they had in the 1980s wearing the exact same dress, to the toy dreamhouse they used to play in with their sister. That powerful sense of nostalgia, and that unifying, almost categorical common ground, is something not many things could manage. Moschino seems to have achieved it to the next level, creating a collection overflowing with universal happy memories. Indeed, Jeremy Scott said of the collection: 'I approach everything with so much humour.' And as gimmicky as some naysayers may have accused it of being, I now have first-hand experience of its mood-enhancing capabilities – for me, and for literally everyone who had my very pink person cross their path. For a start, it turns previously mute colleagues into your new best friend in the office bathroom. People you have literally never laid eyes on before want to have a good old chinwag, all-pink leather acting as some kind of conversational lubricant. Everyone, and I mean everyone, smiles. Doors open. Small animals and children stare. You get a hand with your shopping and a wink with your Starbucks. And when you post a selfie onto Facebook you get 93 likes and 28 comments and it makes you feel a little bit important. At the end of the day, she changed into the piece de résistance; a very short, very wide and very sequinned mini dress and made her way to meet a blissfully unaware friend. 'What in the name of Joan Collins are you wearing? You look like a cake! Don’t stand so close to me,' he said . You also get people who you haven’t heard from in three years sending you dubious private messages, but that’s a small price to pay for becoming a social media sensation for three and a half minutes. Such is the power of pink, people. Practicality, then, becomes almost superfluous. It might be a glorious 30-degree desert day, but I’ll be damned if I’m not going to wear my spray-on leather skirt suit to do the weekly shop. Navigating the supermarket aisles, I felt like a saucy Stepford Wife. A cupcake tray ended up in my basket. And some oven gloves. It was weird. I did, on the other hand, get unwittingly, and worryingly, into character. I forgot a pair of my Louboutins in the toilets after changing outfits. Forgetful Barbie. I, when wearing an enormous puffball dress, tried to answer my office phone whilst standing and ricocheted off my desk. No Sense Of Spacial Awareness Barbie. And when being photographed having a meeting in Ladurée, I shoved a fake macaron in my mouth after being told in no uncertain terms that it was display only. Insanity Barbie. Walking through the streets, the looks were plentiful but surreptitious. Bar a few spectators who stopped to take pictures (thank-you for restoring my faith in shamelessness – I was briefly convinced that everyone had been castrated by manners), people would stare, but only when they thought I couldn’t see. Also: not one person sang Aqua’s Barbie Girl at me. NOT ONE. I mean, come on. Frankly, I was disappointed at the lack of clichés. 'It might be obvious, brash even - but it fits our current filtered, Insta-existence perfectly - there's no denying the collection looks great in a picture,' she said of the experience . It raised that age-old question of whether you dress for yourself or others, as however cheerful my ensemble made me, I still felt the small need for validation from others. It’s kind of the sartorial equivalent of if a tree falls in the forest and there’s no one around to hear it. If you’re outrageously attired and no one bats an eyelid, it kind of takes the fun out of it, no? 'Habibti, this is Dubai,' a straight-shooting friend told me after I had a little moan about it on the (vanity mirror) phone. 'OTT is expected, remember?' Satisfied with this, I changed into the piece de résistance; a very short, very wide and very sequinned mini dress straight outta 1983, and made my merry way to Art Dubai to meet a blissfully unaware friend. 'What in the name of Joan Collins are you wearing? You look like a cake! Don’t stand so close to me,' he said. I’m falling at the last hurdle so decide to rapidly explain myself. 'I’m doing a road test!' I shout over the music. 'A protest? What the hell are you protesting against?! Rational clothing?' Well, two out of three workable outfits ain’t bad. I drag my mortified friend to Q43 and then back to change into my civvies which, I won’t lie, now seem really sad in comparison. If Jeremy Scott has tapped into anything, it’s unadulterated whimsy. It might be obvious, brash even - but it fits our current filtered, Insta-existence perfectly - there’s no denying the collection looks great in a picture. A very wise person once told me life was too short to wear boring clothes. And as long as Scott’s around, there’s really not much danger of that. After completing the challenge, pictured, she changed back into her normal clothes, which she says felt 'sad in comparison'","Olivia Phillips, 30, rocked head-to-toe Moschino .

3fdb4ea786d9d1a43f3819c86a589c2663e8f0bc,"Want to know what you'd look like if you hit the gym and shed a few pounds? Now you can, thanks to a new app that calculates a slimmer version of yourself - without having to do any exercise. ‘Visualize You’ processes an image of you to reveal what you'd look like if you were thinner - and perhaps inspire you to achieve your weight loss goal. Visual Health Studios in Colorado has developed a weight loss app called Visualize You. It calculates what you would look like if you lost a specified amount weight. Shown on the left is TV star James Corden at his current weight, 210lbs (95kg), and on the right he is seen after digitally losing 60lbs (27kg) A picture of Bridesmaids actress Melissa McCarthy at an event in February is shown on the left, and on the right the star is seen after digitally losing 50lbs (23lbs) Users are shown an original and a slimmer version, with a slider, so they can compare how they would look before and after losing weight. The app, which costs £1.61 ($2.40) on Android and £1.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps which stretch or pinch images. The app has been developed with the Wellness Institute of the Cleveland Clinic, the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Centre, and UnitedHealthcare. Actor Jonah Hill, pictured in June 2014, is seen on the left at his normal weight, and on the right he is shown with a digital weight loss of 60lbs (27lbs) It asks you to enter your current height and weight and your target weight, giving you flexibility over how ambitious you want to be. Weight loss specialist Dr Charlie Seltzer told Yahoo Health: ‘Visual cues are very helpful for a lot of people. ‘I will often recommend that people put up pictures of what they want to look like or what they used to look like, provided the body image is healthy. ‘l’d hate for someone to put [their photo] in and see themselves not the way they are going to look, and get discouraged and disgruntled that they’re not changing how they’re supposed to. ‘But my first thought upon hearing about this app, was: ""It sounds like a really good idea.""' Charlie Lankston (lost 20lbs/9kg) Charlie Lankston is seen here before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 20lbs (9kg) 'At first, I thought it was great. The ""after"" picture looks pretty realistic, which I wasn’t actually expecting, and it was amazing to see what I could potentially look like with a few more trips to the gym! 'However, after thinking about it a bit more, I started feeling a slightly ashamed about the size of my actual face. 'Realistically, losing 20lbs is actually a pretty tough task, and the likelihood that I’ll be able to achieve it - and attain my ""skinny face"" - any time soon is pretty ""slim"" which doesn’t make me feel too great. 'Looks like it’s time to hit the treadmill…' Erica Tempesta (lost 38lbs/17kg) Erica Tempesta is seen here before before (left) and after (right) digitally losing 38lbs/17kg . 'It was cool to see such a dramatic difference, but I feel as though the app just changed the shape of my face, which isn’t necessarily how I would look nearly 40lbs lighter. 'My face has always been oval, regardless of my size. The app just made my face look longer as if my cheeks were sucked in. 'I chose a somewhat unrealistic target weight, but it was the size I had been in high school, so based on past pictures, I already had an idea of what my face should have looked like with less weight. 'I personally didn’t think the app gave a realistic rendering of weight loss.' The app allows you to take or upload a photo. You then need to enter your current height and weight, and then also enter your target weight. It will then enable you to 'scroll' through various weights on your way to your target, to see what you would look like . The app, which costs £1.61 ($2.40) on Android and £1.49 ($1.99) on iOS for the full version, has been developed by US company Visual Health Solutions Inc but with the assistance of major American hospitals. The makers say that it uses algorithms which show the effects of weight loss more effectively than other apps . Visualize You is effectively a reverse version of the popular app ‘Fat Booth’ in which users were able to see what they looked like if they were overweight. Fat Booth was launched in 2010 and has been downloaded 35,000,000 times, earning its creators an estimated £16 million ($24 million). Opticians and fashion retailers have made use of similar technology to let users virtually try on glasses on their websites. Dr Michael Roizen, Chairman of Wellness at the Cleveland Clinic, said: ‘Visualize You is a major step forward in helping people approach weight loss in a more informed, educated and fun manner.’ Dr Holly Wyatt, Associate Professor in the Department of Medicine, Division of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Diabetes at the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center added: ‘The app offers individuals a clear-cut end goal for weight loss and provides [users] with an important tool to activate and achieve a successful programme.’ Visualize You was released earlier this month and there are free and paid versions of the app which are available for iPhone and Android.","Visual Health Studios in Colorado has developed a weight loss app .

Mike Hand from Haydock in Merseyside became wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with a tumour on his spinal cord. The 39-year-old is almost ready to leave St Helen's Hospital after undergoing surgery and rehabilitation. Mike Hand pictured with his wife Kate, who has been told he can only have a disability grant to adapt his home if his wife gives up work . Mr Hand, left, has been left wheelchair bound after being diagnosed with a tumour on his spine. He now says he needs to make adaptations to his home in Haydock, Merseyside, right . But after he and his wife Kate, who have an eight-year-old daughter called Mia, tried to claim for financial support to adapt their semi-detached home as they have no bathroom downstairs, they were told they weren't eligible. The couple were told that because they don't claim any income support or benefits, they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant. Mrs Hand, a credit manager for a tool hire firm who earns between £25,000 and £35,000, said: 'It's crazy. I understand that benefits need to be means tested and I agree with that. 'But it's not as if we are after ongoing weekly benefits - just funding to help us create a safe and comfortable home for my husband, who has suffered massively through no fault of his own. Mr Hand and his wife were told that because they don't claim any income support or benefits, they would have to earn 'virtually nothing' to receive the grant . 'If I gave up work we could claim for everything and would be entitled to everything, but because I work and would like to continue to work, we get no help. 'We're having to rely on my salary alone to support two adults and a child. At the end of the month there's nothing left. 'It's a classic example of the system working against the worker. They're almost forcing us to stop working and claim off the state.' The couple are wanting to adapt their home to incorporate a downstairs bedroom and bathroom. But they say because they are unable to do this, it is placing a strain on the family. Mrs Hand added: 'We live in a normal semi-detached house. We don't have a bathroom or bedroom downstairs and my husband will be expected to spend all of his time in the family living room with very little dignity or privacy.' Mr Hand, a former construction worker, became wheelchair bound after doctors failed to spot a tumour in his spinal column, despite him regularly visiting his GP at Haydock Medical Centre complaining of pain. He was referred to hospital for a CAT scan when only an MRI scan would have picked up the growth, caused by a build up of spinal fluid, which stretched half the length of his spine. Eventually the tumour was detected after he was finally sent for an MRI scan in July 2014, when complaining that while running he felt as though he couldn't lift his feet off the ground. He then underwent a 10-hour operation to remove the tumour as surgeons described his diagnosis as a 'ticking time bomb'. But due to existing nerve damage and the trauma of the operation, he has been left paralysed from the waist down with doctors unable to say if he will ever walk again. Mr and Mrs Hand on their wedding day. Mr Hand became wheelchair bound after doctors failed to spot a tumour in his spinal column, despite him regularly visiting his GP complaining of pain .

A St Helens Council spokesman said: 'The council is bound by government means test guidelines, which unfortunately put Mr and Mrs Hand's income above the threshold at which they would qualify for assistance. 'Having said that, we want to help - and are exploring other ways of supporting the family, including the possibility of direct payments to assist Mr Hand at home. 'We look forward to discussing these options with them.' Meanwhile a Haydock Medical Centre spokeswoman added: 'We would like to offer our sincere sympathies to the patient at this difficult time. 'It would be inappropriate for us to comment further due to patient confidentiality, however we want to assure patients that we always aim to provide the best possible care.'","Mark Hand, 39, was left wheelchair bound due to a tumour on his spine .

England's ninth most successful wicket taker of all-time is a loyal friend to the controversial batsman and was best man at his wedding. Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in a last-ditch bid to earn his place in England's Ashes squad this summer - and all eyes will be on Cardiff for the start of his campaign against Glamorgan in just over a fortnight. Darren Gough, Kevin Pietersen's close friend, says his pal only has a small chance of returning for England . Pietersen has rejoined Surrey in the hope of earning a place in the Ashes squad for England this summer . But Gough believes there is still only a slim chance of his friend adding to his tally of 104 Test match appearances when England start their Ashes series on the same ground a few months later. 'I would say it's a pretty small percentage chance of seeing Kevin playing for England again,' said Gough, who is taking part in the second Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for the Lord's Taverners in July, the UK's leading youth cricket and disability sports charity, with the inaugural event raising over £280,000 for the Lord's Taverners and other charities in 2013 . 'It requires England's batsman to fail in the West Indies and then again against New Zealand, which is obviously something no England fan wants. 'The new ECB chairman has given Kevin a lifeline and he's got to make the runs now and put the pressure on. Gough believes Pietersen will 'disappear to the Caribbean Premier League' if he doesn't get an England call . Gough says he has huge respect for Pietersen for pulling out of a big money deal in the India . 'Good luck to him, if the others fail and he scores hundred after hundred, which I think he would have to do, the dream might just come true for him but realistically I would say the door is shut. 'If Kevin isn't selected for the first Test against Australia then he will probably disappear to the Caribbean Premier League and that will be that. 'I have huge respect for him for making that call and pulling out of a big money deal in the Indian Premier League to give it a shot, it shows just how much he wants it. 'If he got to the point where he's retiring and he didn't give it that last go, I don't think he would have been able to deal with that mentally. 'It's similar to me when I left Essex to go back to Yorkshire, I had unfinished business in Yorkshire and I went back for a couple of years. 'I can live happily ever after on that because I went back and fulfilled what I wanted to achieve and it's the same for KP.' Controversial batsman Pietersen and current England coach Peter Moores have a fractious relationship . England face Australia in just under 100 days time - a team with soaring confidence after their World Cup win .

And it doesn't get any easier with two Test and five one-day internationals against in-form New Zealand followed by the arrival of Darren Lehman's Australia in just under 100 days time - a team whose confidence is soaring. 'We've got a good coach with England and he knows what he is doing but his personality is more about percentages,' added Gough. 'He gets a lot of stick about stats but every team uses stats.' Gough plans to competes in the Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge to raise funds for Lord's Taverners charity . While England toil this summer Gough has other plans as he competes in the Investec Ashes Cycle Challenge which will raises funds for the Lord's Taverners charity.

'I'm okay on a motorbike but a bike is going to be a big challenge,' he said. 'We are hoping to raise enough funds to buy five minibuses that can be used to help disadvantaged and disabled children get into sport.

There's nothing unusual about that, you might think, except there's not a child in sight...and the mum is simply colouring in because she wants to. Grown ups reaching for the crayons is a new global trend it seems, as adults say they're attracted to the creativity that colouring in affords. Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford has sold more than 1.4million copies of her colouring-in book for grown-ups, Secret Garden. The follow-up, Enchanted Forest, is expected to do just as well . Art and flowers: The book is the most popular in its genre and has now been translated into 22 languages . If you needed any proof, then browsing Amazon's bestseller list offers it. A book called Secret Garden by Scottish illustrator Johanna Basford, which includes 96 pages of black-and-white drawings has sold more than 1.4million copies and is riding high in the bestsellers chart. So far, it's been translated into 22 different languages. The New York Times has even reported on 'colouring-in groups', where grown-ups meet, as if they were in a knitting circle or book club, just to neatly daub colour on the right side of lines together. The arty fad is said to have started in France, where it was promoted as both a therapeutic hobby and a way of rediscovering lost creativity. Adult colouring-in titles are now said to be outselling cook books in the country, no mean feat for a destination that holds gastronomy so close to its heart. The allure is said to be the unadulterated pleasure of doing something for no purpose other than to enjoy the practice of colouring and staying within the lines. According to experts, it's a kickback against the stresses of modern life and technology, where everything, even leisure time has to be in some way useful or aspirational. The images in Basford's book are not particularly adult in theme, they depict scenes of both nature and fantasy. Basford, 31, told The Times: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it’s a chance to do an analogue activity that’s not on a screen. Everyone is creative deep down but as you get older you get less confident in your abilities.' The artist's second book, Enchanted Forest, is showing all signs of eclipsing the success of her first work. Basford says her success is down to people resisting modern technology in their leisure time. She says: 'Colouring in appeals to people because it’s a chance to do an analogue activity that’s not on a screen' In Australia, colouring-in circles have emerged, such is the pursuit's current popularity. One crayon fantatic Jenny Keane told the Sydney Morning Herald that she even enjoys colouring in with her husband: 'During the week some people like to go to the bar to decompress, whereas my husband and I like to sit down together and just colour.' She adds: 'I can't draw but I like to use my hands to get creative. Some people might use yoga or running but colouring for me is my sense of peace.' A study in the US in 2012 found that colouring in reduced anxiety among university students.","Johanna Basford has sold 1.4million copies of her book Secret Garden .

65a6e45ea6b2aaadc7c1a2a98b5e322d318aa9e4,"(CNN)It's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. After all, this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a Jordanian pilot alive. Such moves are part of this murky group's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information. So what can and should we make of the organization? I explore the issue in depth in a special airing Sunday night. And although it's important to start with the caveat that ISIS is indeed trying to scare and confuse us, I took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of ISIS. First, ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power. There is increasing evidence that the military backbone of ISIS is made up not by a group of Islamic zealots, but rather high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein's army -- Baathists who were at least ostensibly secular. An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the German weekly Der Spiegel. That report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy, much like communism. But underneath it, much like communism, is simply a drive for control, a lust for power. Next, ISIS presents itself as a global organization, but it has thrived because of a local cause. The group has gained territory, cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength. The reality is that that Sunni cause is going to endure for some time. The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq. But the Sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the Sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that ISIS will be able to capitalize on this chaos. In the long run, ISIS might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called Caliphate. The few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by ISIS suggest that, unsurprisingly, people do not like living under a brutal, theocratic dictatorship. They live in fear, and even those who chose it as an alternative to Shiite rule are growing disenchanted. In this respect, ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups, such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract, but once they are actually governing in their medieval, barbarous manner, the allure fades and the disenchantment builds. The result is ever-increasing repression. Remember, no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere. The group simply slaughters its way to control. Of course, one of the big questions has been: Is ISIS a threat to the West? The group's leaders declare that it is. But their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their Arab enemies, on building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They understand, of course, that to be Terror Group No. 1, they must battle the country that is the world's No. 1 power -- the United States. With that in mind, they seek such a confrontation and hope that the United States will come to the Middle East and fight them on their terms, on their terrain. Still, while they are opportunists, and they ask and hope that their followers act in America, their main focus is not to come here -- they want Americans to go there. Yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat ISIS poses, the group has changed the nature of terror. The leaders of ISIS have recognized that above all, they are a messaging machine, which in turn becomes a recruitment machine. This means that the key is not what happens on the ground, but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the Internet. And ISIS does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web. The shock and awe they produce makes them go viral, and thus are seen by tens of millions. That ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims -- who seek revenge, glory and gore. Unfortunately, as long as those young Muslim men, scattered across the globe, are attracted to ISIS and stream to its cause, the group presents the world with a danger that is impossible to fully assess but is one that grows by the month.","Fareed Zakaria: ISIS has thrived because of a local Sunni cause in Syria and Iraq .

The Premier League champions have had a disappointing campaign under manager Manuel Pellegrini and are down in fourth position, 12 points behind runaway leaders Chelsea with five matches left to play.

We've let ourselves down at key moments. 'It's a difficult league to win. The two times we've won it, it's gone right to the wire,' Hart added of their title triumphs in 2012 and 2014. 'This season, in a lot of games we've played well but teams have tended to raise their game against us. It's just how it is, that's not me moaning.'

That is the verdict of colleague Andrew Thornton when trying to explain what has made AP McCoy such a dominant force in his sport. Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Thornton has been one of the few weighing room colleagues to witness McCoy's entire career, from shy newcomer to national sporting superstar. AP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires following a successful career . McCoy has two rides at Sandown on Saturday before he retires from professional racing for good . 'It is a bit like watching Lionel Messi on a horse,' said Thornton. 'He had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. 'It might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20-time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But AP loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. 'He judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for Jonjo O'Neill. 'When he was with Martin Pipe, it was often a case of make sure you put everyone to the sword a mile from home. He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around Cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. 'He is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's Grand National, and when he won it in 2010 on Don't Push It, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. 'You also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends . Thornton, who needs fewer than 20 winners to reach 1,000 in his career, says age has mellowed McCoy, who is an unassuming figure among his colleagues. Former jockey Luke Harvey, now a TV presenter for At The Races, agrees. 'He has never been the big 'I am'. 'I used to run The Blowing Stone pub in Lambourn and he would come along even though he doesn't drink. 'He would stand in and play for the pool team and what p***ed you off was that he was good at that as well. McCoy and Mr Mole will have six rivals in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday . 'Before he was married, his home was like a doss house, full of jockeys who got back late from racing and could not be bothered to go home. 'Seamus Durack (now a Lambourn trainer) bought a house but liked living at AP's so much he rented it out and stayed at AP's.' Richard Hughes, champion Flat jockey, is impressed by McCoy's legendary focus. 'I was on holiday with him in Portugal.

0365375ec8a07dc6b3b21dbe6f0c8ce9a30fac22,"Raheem Sterling and Theo Walcott will likely go head-to-head at the Emirates on Saturday. They are at starkly different places in their careers with 26-year-old Walcott perhaps acting as a cautionary tale for Sterling, 20, that early promise can sometimes give way to unfulfilled potential. Both are in the process of negotiating contracts with their respective clubs. Brendan Rodgers has spoken in the past of his admiration for Walcott while Wenger has made no secret he is a fan of Sterling. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that the clubs could do a direct swap. Although Wenger would have to deviate from his usually cautious financial approach to win the race to sign Sterling while Rodgers would be hard pushed to sell Walcott as a worthy replacement for Sterling. Here Sportsmail looks at the merits of the two English wingers. Theo Walcott and Raheem Sterling, England's leading wingers, are both in contract negotians with their clubs . Sterling has been one of Liverpool's best players this season, but his contract dispute has caused problems . THIS SEASON SO FAR . Sterling: He has been one of Liverpool’s best players throughout the season, making 28 Premier League appearances and scoring six top-flight goals while boasting an impressive 81% pass completion rate. He has as struggled to make an impact since being used as a wing-back. Walcott: There’s not a lot to go on for Walcott, who has played just 13 games in all competitions, struggling for game time after returning from a long-term layoff for a knee injury. Arsenal do seem to perform slightly better when Walcott features, winning 62.50% of their Premier League games when he is in the team, compared to 59.1% without him. TEAM PLAYER? Sterling: While Sterling’s contract negotiations might be viewed as a distraction to the team he has been an unselfish and determined player during his career so far, providing seven assists in the Premier League this season. He has linked up well with Daniel Sturridge before the striker was injured and happily played second fiddle to Luis Suarez last season when Brendan Rodgers built his team around the Uruguayan. Walcott: Is always encouraging to younger players and a good influence to have in the dressing room but he has failed to provide one assist this season and rarely contributes to defensive duties. Walcott looked out of sorts for England this week, and has not yet provided an assist this season . Sterling turns away from Arsenal's Kieran Gibbs when the two clubs met earlier this season . WOW FACTOR . Sterling: Sterling is undoubtedly exciting, can provoke disbelief with his mazy runs and deceptive strength for someone so slight. But his biggest strength is his pace. His top speed this season of 21.77 mph puts him sixth in the Premier League rankings. The problem could lie in the fact he may not be as good as he thinks he is. Walcott: The off-the-mark pace and an eye for the unconventional yet effective pass which made Walcott a sensation as a 16-year-old playing for Southampton have waned somewhat. Although he is still quick, his fastest sprint this season registering at 21.11 mph, a series of injuries have impacted his speed. His inventiveness off-the-ball has been dulled by a lack of confidence. If he can have a period of uninterrupted play he might be able to recapture some of his ‘wow factor’ but he is never going to be a world-class player or a game changer. First team opportunities have been limited for Walcott this season, with the winger frustrated by injury . Sterling has scored six times and created 62 chances in the Premier League this season . FANS' FAVOURITE? Sterling: Sterling has damaged his public image, possibly irreparably, in the red half of Merseyside with protracted contract wrangling over recent weeks. He said in an interview with the BBC’s Natalie Perks that he wanted to dispel the idea he was a greedy 20-year-old. But he could have done that simply by signing a £100,000 a week contract at a club where he plays regularly and the manager is proven at developing young talent, if that really was the case. Walcott: He is a likeable personality, rarely in the headlines for the wrong reasons, but fans will ultimately judge him on his play and Walcott seems to divide opinion. He has flashes of brilliance but his form is erratic and fans want someone they can count on. THE FUTURE . Sterling: It is easy to forget Sterling, who made his full Liverpool debut at 17 years, 107 days, is still only 20. On the face of it his future is blindingly bright and his potential boundless. Sterling has hit a top speed of 21.77 mph this season, ranking him sixth in the Premier League.  Walcott's fastest speed this season is 21.11 mph. Clubs all over Europe are said to be monitoring him and he has admitted it is his dream to play for a big club ‘somewhere warm’ but we have seen all too many times young talent going unrealised. The decisions Sterling and his advisors make in the coming months could be crucial. Walcott: For Walcott, who was selected for his first World Cup at 16, the last six years have been marred by a failure to deliver on his promise. Those clubs who might be interested in signing him should take encouragement from the fact we might not have seen the best of Walcott yet. Sterling might have permanently damaged his relationship with the Liverpool fans with his interview . The 20-year-old could still stay at Anfield beyond this summer if manager Brendan Rodgers gets his way .","Arsene Wenger is a great admirer of Raheem Sterling, while both he and Theo Walcott are struggling to negotiate new deals .

ed0a5c0fdb00ec36b24ebe9b9d8e65f5a7403b27,"A cancer survivor who had to have part of his mouth removed after a tumour stopped him from swallowing has been given a new tongue made out of part of his arm. David Billing, 48, has told how he had to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital, during which surgeons sawed through his jawbone and removed part of his tongue. Medics then replaced the lost tissue with muscle from Mr Billing's arm. The only drawback is that it still has hairs on it, and he now has to return to the hospital every few weeks to have it shaved. David Billing, 48, had to have part of his tongue removed after being diagnosed with mouth cancer, so doctors made him a new one out of skin from his arm - which still has hairs on it . The dramatic story began after Mr Billing, a part-time welder, went to his GP in October 2013 after being unable to swallow. After a second doctor's appointment, he was referred to Royal Derby where specialists discovered an ulcer on the right-hand side of his tongue and confirmed it was cancer after a biopsy. He said: 'Being told I had cancer was mind-blowing and a real low point for me. I had no idea when they found this ulcer in my mouth that this was what it would be.' It was a double-blow for Mr Billing, as he had been made redundant just a week before from his job at digger manufacturer JCB. He said: 'It was all so overwhelming. My life and everything was ticking along nicely and the next thing I knew I'd lost my job and needed to have a major operation.' David had the procedure to remove the lump and rebuild his tongue on November 13, 2013. He said: 'I had to have a stomach tube fitted first and then go through the main procedure. Mr Billing was forced to undergo 14 hours of surgery at Royal Derby Hospital (pictured), with surgeons sawing between two teeth and through his jaw to get to the tumour . 'They had to cut through the jawbone and get my face wide open to get to the ulcer then they had to remove some lymph nodes in my neck too, just to be safe in case the cancer had spread.' David spent nine days in hospital after his operation, returning now only for check-ups and once for the smaller procedure to reshape his tongue. He said: 'Usually, people have to go on chemotherapy or radiotherapy after the operation and, during this, the skin tissue used to rebuild the tongue shrinks in size. 'Because I didn't need either, it meant I later needed this smaller operation to have the bit of skin trimmed. 'My tongue's absolutely fine. I had to have speech therapy after the procedure but it's not had any long term impact on my speech or my eating or drinking.' David continued to use a feeding tube and relied on liquid foods until his first proper meal on Christmas Day 2013. And, in another fortunate turn of events, he was offered his old job a JCB back in March 2014. He added: 'JCB actually took me back having originally laid me off because of a lack of work. Mr Billing, who is now preparing to run the London Marathon to raise money for Cancer Research, says his speech is back to normal - though he does have to go to hospital to have his tongue shaved . 'It was the best feeling in the world when, two weeks after coming through the operation, the consultant told me the cancer was completely removed and I didn't even need radiotherapy or chemotherapy.' Now David is preparing to run the London Marathon and is hoping to raise more than £3,000 for cancer research. He said: 'I was not fit or well at all when I was watching the London Marathon last year but I thought how much I'd love to do it. 'I've never done anything like it before so, when I started feeling better, I decided to start training and now I'm about to take part in this experience of a lifetime. 'If I can get over the finish line, whatever time I do it in, it will be absolutely brilliant.'","David Billing, 48, diagnosed with cancer after being left unable to swallow .

fc9b4cc0f0342896bb47125513ad187bc66e22c3,"Swansea manager Garry Monk believes a strong finish will put a different slant on Everton's season - but he is determined to stop his former manager Roberto Martinez profiting at his old Liberty Stadium stomping ground on Saturday. Martinez was lauded by Everton fans last season as the club qualified for Europe with a fifth-placed finish in the Barclays Premier League. But the going has been a lot tougher for the Spaniard in his second season on Merseyside with Everton having only removed the spectre of relegation by winning their last three matches. Garry Monk wants Swansea to continue their own impressive form with victory over Everton on Saturday . Bafetimbi Gomis (centre) scored twice for Swansea in their 3-1 victory over Hull last weekend . Ki Sung-Yueng (second right) also got on the scoresheet as Swansea maintained their impressive form . Vandals even defaced the outside of Goodison Park with 'Martinez Out' and 'Not Good Enough' sprayed on the wall of a stand in white paint, but Monk insists that is simply a part of modern-day football when results do not go your way. 'I always say you're only a few games away from being great or rubbish,' Monk said. 'Roberto is a good manager, but sometimes you have good periods and sometimes you have bad ones. 'It's just making sure you come through them and he's won the last three games, they're back on the up and he'll want to finish the season strongly. 'Of course they'd want to be pushing further up the league and it's not a position you'd associate with Everton. 'But if they can get back up to finish positively it will put a different twist on the season.' Everton have had to balance their domestic commitments with a demanding Europa League campaign which saw them knocked out at the round-of-16 stage last month. And Monk knows from Swansea being in the competition last season how much that has an impact on Premier League performances and results. 'Europe is tough, the travelling and constant games in certain periods,' Monk said. 'It all adds up and the intensity of the football at this level takes it out of you and takes its toll. 'Whether it (Everton's results) is all down to that I don't know, but it does play a major part and if you look at the teams who have played in the Europa League, including ourselves, it has had an impact.' Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league but they claimed a point at Goodison Park in November after being reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey's dismissal. Martinez criticised Swansea's 'strange' tactics and style of play that day but Monk put it down to 'more frustration with his own side and not winning the game'. Roberto Martinez is hoping to continue Everton's form against his former team in the Premier League . Monk (right) holds no ill feeling towards Martinez, despite him criticising Swansea after defeat in November . 'It might have been a game they'd targeted to win and when it doesn't happen as a manager you do get frustrated,' said Monk, who knows victory will take Swansea past their previous best Premier League points total of 47. 'That's what it boiled down to. But we did well, we had Jonjo sent off so we were never going to go gung-ho and we got a good point.

He told the ABC: 'I've been with her for five years and... [her disappearance is] just out of the blue, out of character for her. 'It is the worst thing I have ever been through. You can't eat and you can't sleep,' mother Merrilyn Scott told AAP on Wednesday. 'I think today, if we don't find her today... you can't let yourself think about it but you do.' Their wedding was planned to take place at the Eat Your Greens function centre in the NSW town of Eugowra . Kim Scott said her sister had designed the invitations and handmade pots for the reception table placements .

c5f7779cc0b551221e803440b5104bdbb9225a5f,"Defense attorneys released some of the training records Saturday for a 73-year-old volunteer sheriff's deputy charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect in Oklahoma. The records for Robert Bates include certificates showing what training he received, job evaluation reports and weapons training and qualification records dating to 2008. Bates' attorneys said the 64 pages of information include records Bates, of Tulsa, copied and kept for himself. Although there are time gaps in the documents provided, some of the records seem to indicate Bates was proficient in firearms and dozens of other training courses. Scroll down for videos . Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . 'For the first time today, we feel like someone's starting to look at the other side of this as far as his qualifications,' Scott Wood, an attorney for Bates, said after the documents were released. Bates has said he mistakenly pulled out a handgun rather than a stun gun when he fatally shot Eric Harris on April 2 as he lay on the ground. He has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Bates spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed in the April 2 incident. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. Support: He appeared on the Today show on Friday flanked by family members and his lawyer, right . 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, 'I don't understand how this can happen'. You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. The Tulsa County volunteer deputy disputed earlier this week a Tulsa World report that sheriff's office supervisors were ordered to falsify his training records. Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' The World said at least three of Bates' supervisors were transferred for refusing to go along with the requests, and said it consulted multiple sources who spoke on condition of anonymity, but it gave no indication how those sources were familiar with the situation. Harris' family attorney — who had questioned Bates' qualifications as a reserve deputy — did not return a message seeking comment Saturday. A call to the district attorney's office rang unanswered, and the sheriff's office referred questions to Wood. 'I want to do everything I can to make sure that people know that this allegation of falsified records is not true,' Wood said. His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Charged: Harris (pictured left) died from his injuries and Bates (right in his mug shot) has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. He faces four years in prison if he is convicted . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. Bates faces four years in prison if convicted.","Tulsa County Sheriff's Office reserve deputy Robert Bates faces a charge of second-degree manslaughter for the April 2 shooting of Eric Harris .

656a6253699073f08fdb5f65bc3daaafbc35d65b,"Hong Kong (CNN)It's not just Asia. Around the world, we're becoming collectively more near-sighted. Near-sightedness, or myopia, means nearby objects appear clearly, but those farther away look blurry. The rates of myopia have doubled, even tripled, in most of East Asia over the last 40 years, researchers say. Several places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan have rates in the 80%. In South Korea, myopia rates among 20-year-olds have leaped from 18% in 1955 to over 96% myopia in 2011. And it's a global issue -- rates of myopia are also rising in Western nations like Germany and the United States. ""It's about 40% in the U.S., compared to about 25% in the 1970s,"" said Dr. Michael Chiang, clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. But researchers say reducing risk of myopia is easy, free and readily-available: Get some sunlight. Sometimes, though, the easiest solutions are the hardest to implement. The epidemic of myopia amongst East Asians has triggered cultural questions about why so many young people develop vision problems. Many have long believed that reading, studying or staring at your phone caused short-sightedness. And there's the usual grumblings that young people spend way too much time glued to their screens. But researchers are focusing on a different cause. ""If children get outside enough, it doesn't matter how much they study they do. They don't become myopic,"" said Ian Morgan, researcher at Australian National University. Researchers say kids and teens need to get sunlight during the critical years of their development while their eyeballs are still growing. The mechanics of how sunlight protects their eyes are not clearly understood. One theory suggests that sunlight triggers the release of dopamine in the retina; another speculates that blue light from the sun protects from the condition. The solution is simple. Have kids ""spend more time outside, have less demands (from) the schools and relax a bit,"" said Seang Mei Saw, professor of epidemiology at the National University of Singapore. But studying and play time are often at odds with each other. In Asian cultures where there is heavy emphasis on education and hyper-competitiveness, forcing playtime is easier said than done. ""The problem is teachers and parents are probably not going to let kids,"" said Dr. Nathan Congdon, professor at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center at the Sun Yat Sen University in China. ""There's a limit to how many hours kids can go outside."" There have been some attempts to protect children's eyesight. In China, students have been mandated by its education ministry to perform daily eye exercises. Since 1963, rows of students sit at their desks and massage the pressure points around their eyes as a revolutionary-era anthem blares through the PA system. Despite these eye exercises, rates of myopia in urban China have soared to nearly 90%, according to recent studies. ""China has among the highest rates of myopia and it's the only country in the world that does eye exercises, so it's probably not working all that well,"" said Congdon. Their effectiveness has been doubted by experts in China, but the exercises remain a part of the students' daily experience. Myopia may seem like a minor inconvenience. People have to deal with glasses, contact lenses and even laser eye surgery. But researchers say there are serious implications of such high rates of myopia among young people. In Singapore, 82% of 20-year-olds are myopic. By the time these young adults hit their 60s, many of their vision problems are likely to get worse. ""They grow older and the epidemic is then in older adults,"" said Saw, head of the myopia unit at the Singapore Eye Research Institute. As people age, they can become at higher risk for severe eye disorders such as high myopia, glaucoma (optic nerve damage), cataracts (clouding of the lens) and retinal detachment. These conditions could lead to vision loss and blindness. To negotiate the expectations of parents and classes, researchers are experimenting ways to help students get increased exposure to sunlight. One of the studies underway is the ""bright light classroom"" where the school's walls and ceilings are made of see-through plastic that allows in light. Hundreds of students attend this unusual  elementary school in Guangdong province. ""It's a potential way to increase the amount of light, in hopes of preventing myopia and allow kids to continue (their) education without inconvenience for them,"" Morgan said. Researchers want to measure the rates of myopia among students in these ""bright light classrooms"" compared with those in traditional classes. Building schools costs money -- especially experimental see-through schools. But researchers say there are low-cost solutions. In one Taiwanese study, teachers locked the students out of the classroom during recess and lunch time. In that 2013 study, students boosted their time in sunlight by 80 minutes during the school day.  Fewer children in that school became nearsighted compared with those from another school that didn't follow such a policy. Researchers hope with greater understanding of this condition, far-sighted policies could save the next generation of children's eyesight.","East Asia sees soaring rates of myopia, with 80-90% of young adult population affected .

f97b9b19e5a90dce0fc0b098f2a7f70ec36445fb,"(CNN)Police added attempted murder to the list of charges against the mother of a quadriplegic man who was left in the woods for days, Philadelphia police spokeswoman Christine O'Brien said Tuesday. Nyia Parler cannot be extradited to face the charges in Philadelphia until she completes an unspecified ""treatment,"" Maryland police said Monday. When she does arrive, she will be charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person and related offenses, in addition to the attempted murder count, O'Brien said. The Montgomery County (Maryland) Department of Police took Parler, 41, into custody Sunday after Philadelphia police reported that she left her 21-year-old son in the woods while she hopped a bus to see her boyfriend in Maryland. A man walking through the woods found him Friday ""lying in leaves, covered in a blanket with a Bible and a wheelchair nearby,"" Philadelphia police say. Citing federal health care privacy laws, Montgomery County police spokesman Capt. Paul Starks said he could not divulge why Parler was receiving treatment, but he said she had to complete it before she could be extradited. She remained in treatment as of Tuesday morning, Starks told CNN. If she chooses not to challenge her extradition, she will be transported to Philadelphia once the treatment is complete, he said. For more than four days, police say, the quadriplegic man, who also suffers from cerebral palsy, was left lying in the woods of Philadelphia's Cobbs Creek Park. Low temperatures reached the mid-30s during the week, and rain was reported in the area Wednesday and Thursday. The man is unable to communicate how he came to be in the park, but Philadelphia police Lt. John Walker told reporters that the man's mother left him there the morning of April 6. Starks identified the mother as Parler on Monday. ""The mother went to visit her boyfriend down in Maryland, over in Montgomery County, and we believe she placed the child into Cobbs Creeks Park,"" Walker said at a news conference. Walker told CNN the man was transported to Presbyterian Hospital, but CNN affiliates reported he was being treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He suffered eye problems, dehydration, malnutrition and a cut to his back that raised infection concerns, the lieutenant told reporters. ""This kid's obviously a fighter,"" Walker said during a Saturday news conference. ""It's just unbelievable how we found him out there last night. To see that kid laying there, it's heartbreaking to see another human, especially a mother, can treat someone like that."" Officials at Philadelphia's School of the Future, which the man attends, became concerned when he didn't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt, Philadelphia police said. ""The aunt was in contact via text message with Nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant, Nyia replied, 'We're OK,' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with Nyia in Maryland,"" according to a police news release. When police tracked down the mother, she told them her son was with her, Walker said. ""She indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in Maryland,"" he said. The boyfriend was not aware of what happened, Walker told CNN affiliate KYW-TV. Walker told reporters she bore ""clear criminal liability in this case."" There was no reason for the man to suffer, Walker told philly.com, because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him. Two of his aunts, who have tried to obtain guardianship of him, were staying with him at the hospital, police told the website. Parler's sister told police that Parler has another child, a 16-year-old. The mother's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation, Walker told reporters. Authorities are interested in learning more about ""how this kid was cared for, and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies."" CNN's Chuck Johnston and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Philadelphia police add attempted murder to list of charges mom will face .

A memorial service has been finalised to take place at the Eat Your Greens function centre in Eugowra, near Ms Scott's home town of Canowindra in rural Central West NSW and around a three hour drive from Leeton where she worked. Ms Scott was excitedly preparing the last minute details for her wedding and her honeymoon to Tahiti with her partner of five years Aaron Leeson-Woolley, when she disappeared from her workplace at Leeton High School on Easter Sunday. She was set to tie the knot last Saturday at the Eat Your Greens centre, instead her life will be celebrated in the same place at a memorial at 1pm this Wednesday. On Thursday the parish priest officiating at the ceremony said he was bracing himself for a hugely emotional occasion. High school teacher Stephanie Scott's funeral will be held at the venue where she was set to get married .

Reverend Jonno Williams, the parish priest of the Anglican-Uniting Church at Canowindra, confirmed the venue to the ABC. He told Daily Mail Australia he knows the family well and is expecting it to be a tough day for everyone. ‘I know Stephanie’s father relatively well through the time that he taught at the local Canowindra High School,' Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia. 'It’s going to be a very difficult time for everyone, especially for the young people in town who knew her well.’ Reverend Williams was also yet another person who sang the praises of the young teacher whose heart-breaking tale has gripped Australia in recent weeks. ‘She was vice-captain of Canowindra High School and worked at the local swimming pool when she was younger,' Reverend Williams told Daily Mail Australia.

'She also worked at the local supermarket, so she was well known by everyone here from a young age. ‘Throughout this time Stephanie was always known for her friendly disposition and she was always friendly with anyone that she met. ‘I met her a few times myself and she showed herself to be a very friendly and cheerful girl. The community both here in Canowindra and in Leeton will be out in force to say their goodbyes on Wednesday.’ Less than a week before her wedding the Leeton high school teacher went missing on Easter Sunday. For the past 12 months, Ms Scott had been excitedly preparing her wedding to Mr Leeson-Woolley. The pair met as children playing soccer in the NSW central west town of Canowindra, where they grew up. Ms Scott was a popular teacher at Leeton High School where students paid homage to her . The 26-year-old's burned body was found around five metres from a road in Cocoparra National Park, north of Griffith, NSW, on Friday April 10 by police in an area where her accused killer, Vincent Stanford went on regular camping trips. School cleaner Stanford, 24, has been charged with her murder and is due to appear in court in June. The remains of Ms Scott have been formally identified. NSW Health says a post-mortem has been completed at Glebe Morgue in Sydney and a report is in the hands of the coroner.

On Monday, Ms Scott's devastated father opened up about the grief her family is feeling as they struggle to come to terms with their daughter's brutal murder, which took place just days before her wedding. Ms Scott's grieving father Robert explained that it is especially painful that Stephanie's life has been taken away when she had so much to look forward to. She was also a person who gave so much joy to others. 'Stephanie's aim was to get everyone feeling like it was their wedding as much as hers,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph, describing Ms Scott's bubbly and thoughtful personality. There are reminders of the wedding all over the house, yet instead of a wedding the Scott family must tragically prepare for Stephanie's funeral. 'You walk around the house and there's so many little things she planned for the wedding,' said Mr Scott. Ms Scott and Mr Leeson-Woolley had been taking dancing lessons together to prepare for their first dance as an excited married couple, according to Robert.

Dame Barbara Hakin, national director of commissioning operations for NHS England, was accused of gagging a whistleblower who tried to warn about the impact of targets on ordinary patients. She was investigated by the General Medical Council, which concluded that there was no case to answer. However, it is now reviewing part of this decision and is appointing an independent expert to consider if the original investigation went ‘far enough’ in respect of patient safety. The GMC is concerned that there ‘may have been a material flaw’ in the previous decision, which could lead to the case being reopened. Dame Barbara, 57, a former Bradford GP who worked alongside Sir David Nicholson when he was NHS chief, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority. Mr Walker and other senior executives at the United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust (ULHT) claim that they had raised concerns with her that the enforcement of targets – implemented by the last Labour government – was endangering lives. This, they alleged, contributed to the trust being in the bottom 25 of the Department of Health’s mortality league tables and being compared to the scandal-hit Mid Staffs. They took their allegations to the GMC, the regulatory body for doctors, who investigated but concluded that there was no case to answer. But following complaints to the watchdog about its review, it is calling for an independent report. The GMC said the absence of such a report ‘may amount to a material flaw in the investigation’ that may have affected the decision. ‘There are concerns that the evidence gathered in the initial investigation did not go far enough in relation to allegations surrounding patient safety,’ it said. The GMC concluded that the review is ‘necessary for the protection of the public’. Dame Barbara, 57, a former GP, was criticised for the gagging of whistleblower Gary Walker (above), who tried to warn about the impact of targets, while she was in charge of East Midlands Strategic Health Authority . It added: ‘The specific question here is whether Dr Hakin’s fitness to practise could be called into question on the basis of her insistence that ULHT met the NHS targets no matter what. Further evidence from an external independent expert would have been useful to consider whether Dr Hakin’s actions were reasonable in all of the circumstances.’ Dame Barbara, who earns around £205,000 in her current role and was referred to as the most powerful woman in the NHS by the Health Service Journal, said the original allegations were ‘spurious and vexatious’. She alleged they stemmed from the ‘failure’ of the ULHT board to manage the hospital and it was a ‘campaign to discredit her’. Mr Walker said yesterday: ‘I am delighted the GMC is now considering that when Dr Hakin put pressure on me and my colleagues to hit targets it may have put the lives of patients at risk. ‘The NHS tried to gag me and prevent me from giving evidence to the GMC but what really happened is finally being exposed. ‘I hope now the GMC will do the right thing and seek to remove Dr Hakin’s licence.’ A GMC spokesman said it was ‘reviewing a decision made as part of our original investigation’ but added that Dame Barbara was not under investigation. Labour insisted that it was ‘always clear that NHS targets should not be implemented in a way that jeopardises the quality of patient care’.","Dame Barbara Hakin, 57, facing threat of a new inquiry over patient safety .

It turns out the 55-year-old has been attending regular Zumba classes, and it's paid off. The Scottish presenter revealed that attending the classes - up to four times a week - has helped her drop two dress sizes, from a 14 to a 10. Scroll down for video . Lorraine Kelly (pictured left) has managed to drop two dress sizes by attending regular Zumba classes with her instructor, Maxine Jones (pictured right) Zumba is a fitness programme, combining Latin and international music, and incorporates aerobic elements across various styles of dance. The classes vary in price, but average at about £5. In an interview with Woman, Kelly gushed about her Zumba instructor, Maxine Jones. She said: 'Maxine's changed my life. I have more energy now and that helps me look and feel younger.' In the interview, the 55-year-old also revealed her excitement about her new weight loss. As the presenter of her own eponymous ITV show, which airs early in the morning every weekday, it's understandable that feeling good in front of the camera is important to Kelly. The 55-year old is no stranger to exercise, and ran the London Marathon back in 2010 . Zumba is a dance fitness programme that combines several dance styles and aerobic activity . She explained: 'I've never had a waist before, I didn't have that curviness, but now I have and I look better. 'I'm a size 10 and I love being able to go into the shops and buy a top because I like it and not because I want to hide my bottom.' Kelly also explained that Zumba had helped her develop a new-found confidence, and that at the age of 55, she had more confidence than she had ever felt. She added: 'I was never unfit, but I was never truly fit. I'd done marathons but more out of determination. 'But Zumba is so much fun…I feel more confident now in my fifties than I have ever felt. Confidence comes from within.' And Lorraine also found a friend for life in instructor Maxine. Maxine started instructing in 2011, and prior to this, had been a banker for 20 years. She explained: 'Maxine's more like a friend now – she makes me laugh. 'She's 45 and I'm 55 ­– we always joke that our combined ages add up to 100!'

d7af283e30d2bb5a9075f308849c4325a13a4af0,"Disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus will not go to jail for giving his mistress classified material while she was working on a book about him, a judge ruled today. The former U.S. Army General, whose career was destroyed when the affair with Paula Broadwell emerged in November 2012, avoided jail time at the hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday and was instead sentenced to two years probation. He was also fined $100,000 - more than double the $40,000 his attorneys had requested. While Petraeus had agreed two months ago to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, he formally entered his plea during Thursday's hearing. Petraeus was wearing his wedding ring but there was no sign of his wife, Holly. He told the court he wanted to apologize to those closest to him 'for the pain my actions caused'. Apologies: Former CIA director David Petraeus apologized for his 'mistakes' as he spoke outside the North Carolina courthouse where he was sentenced to two years probation on Thursday afternoon . Sentenced: As well as the probation, he was fined $100,000 for leaking classified information to his mistress . Following the hearing, he briefly addressed the media outside the courthouse. 'As I did in the past, I apologize for those closest to me and many others,' he said, before thanking his supporters including his family, colleagues and fellow veterans. 'I now look forward to moving on with the next phase of my life and with continuing to serve our great nation as a private citizen,' he added. Critics have noted that in other cases concerning government leaks, defendants have received far harsher punishments than Petraeus. CIA analyst John Kiriakou who is serving 30 months behind bars for revealing the secret CIA torture program. Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represents Edward Snowden, told Reuters that he was not against lighter sentences - as long as such treatment is handed out equally. 'The problem is not that David Petraeus is getting lenient treatment,' Wizner said. 'The problem is that lenient treatment is only available to people in high places.' Petraeus was also given special conditions for his probation. He is allowed to travel internationally with his probation officer's approval, for example, and is allowed to possess firearms. He is allowed to pay the $100,000 fine $25,000 per month until it is paid in full. Going solo: Petraeus, who was seen wearing his wedding ring to  court, was not accompanied by his wife Holly to the sentencing hearing. It emerged in 2012 that he had been having an affair with his biographer . Petraeus has 14 days to file an appeal if he wants to dispute the sentencing. In the previous agreement, prosecutors said that while Broadwell was writing her book in 2011, Petraeus gave her eight binders of classified material he had improperly kept from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Days later, he took the binders back to his house. Among the secret information contained in the 'black books' were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus' discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors said. Those binders were later seized by the FBI in an April 2013 search of Petraeus' Arlington, Virginia, home, where he had kept them in the unlocked drawer of a desk in a ground-floor study. Prosecutors said that after resigning from the CIA in November 2012, Petraeus had signed a form falsely attesting he had no classified material. He also lied to FBI agents by denying he supplied the information to Broadwell, according to court documents. Affair: Petraeus gave his mistress Paula Broadwell, pictured together in 2011, classified material that he had improperly kept from his time in the military. She was writing his biography at the time . Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down, while in May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the relationship. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus held the CIA post less than a year, not long enough to leave a significant mark on the spy agency. The core of his identity has been a military man. He was brought in by President George W. Bush to command multinational forces in Iraq in 2007, a period when the war began to turn in favor of the U.S. Petraeus' command coincided with the 'surge' of American forces in Iraq and a plan to pay Sunni militias to fight al-Qaeda in Iraq. With American help, the Sunni tribes were able to push out insurgents and enable U.S. troops to withdraw in 2011. Those same Sunni areas are now controlled by the Islamic State group, which evolved from the remnants of al-Qaida after Iraqi's Shiite-led government proved weak.","The former U.S. Army General appeared in court in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday for his sentencing hearing .

Another Instagram snapshot, which was also posted yesterday, shows Maggie sporting patterned shorts and a pink tank as she poses next to Alex, who is holding their baby girl. 'Cecilia's first trip to the beach!' she wrote. Later that night, Maggie shared a picture of her and her husband enjoying wine and a glass of something bubbly during a romantic 'island' dinner.

Pretty in pink: Maggie and Cecilia donned matching pastel outfits for Easter . All bump: Maggie showed off her growing belly with a selfie she took in January . Maggie rarely models but remains in demand, despite having moved to San Francisco for her husband's work. She was last seen on the catwalk in September 2014 at Michael Kors' New York Fashion Week show. Though her pregnancy was not public knowledge at the time, she would have been four months' pregnant - a point at which most expectant women start to show a small bump. Maggie, who originally hails from New York State, was one of the world's most popular models in the late Nineties and early 2000s. She stopped modeling in 2004 after it emerged that her stepfather, John Breen, who had been handling her finances, gambled away her entire fortune. Her professional earnings alone were estimated to be over $7million, though she also lost inheritance left by her biological father, Kevin Rizer, after his death from AIDS when she was 14. Since the loss of her father - her parents divorced when she was a baby when Kevin announced that he was gay - the model has been a staunch AIDS awareness activist.","The 37-year-old welcomed her first daughter Cecilia Kathryn into the world on February 9 .

""Roots,"" the epic miniseries about an African-American slave and his descendants, had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977. Now A&E networks are remaking the miniseries, to air in 2016. A&E, Lifetime and History (formerly the History Channel) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte, an African who was captured, shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation. LeVar Burton, who portrayed Kinte in the original, will co-executive produce the new miniseries. A press release describes the new version as ""original"" and ""contemporary"" and will draw more from Alex Haley's classic novel, ""Roots: The Saga of an American Family."" Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity. ""We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original, as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time,"" said Dirk Hoogstra, History's executive vice president and general manager. ""Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte's indomitable spirit."" Executive producer Mark Wolper, son of the original's producer David L. Wolper, added, ""Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage, to Alex Haley, to my father, and now the mantle rests with me. Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again, so must we."" The remade ""Roots"" will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation's first African-American president and ""12 Years a Slave"" win the Oscar for Best Picture, but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities.

1ccd5e759d3f52819227f67382e3e8663d3c1e76,"An amorous Italian couple have been fined £9,000 for having such noisy sex that it forced their neighbours to move out. The pair, who are in their 30s, were convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the 'raucous screams' during steamy sex sessions at their apartment in the northern town of San Martino. Their long-suffering neighbours, who first took them to court in 2009, described the wails of passion as 'deafening' and said it kept them and their two children awake. The couple, who are in their 30s, have been ordered to pay £9,000 after being convicted of noise pollution and harassment for the 'deafening' screams during sex sessions at their home in San Martino, Italy (file picture) The man, who has not been named, was sentenced to four months in prison in 2011, and his fiancée given a noise abatement order. But the couple appealed the sentence and have now been ordered to pay £7,000 in damages to their neighbours who now live elsewhere, and £2,000 in legal fees. The apartment next door to the noisy couple currently remains unoccupied, the Provincia Pavese newspaper said. It comes less than six months after a woman from Tyne and Wear, in the north east of England, was given a 12-week jail term and a four-year anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) for having noisy sex. Neighbours complained about Caroline Cartwright's loud screams during sex sessions with her husband of 38 years and moaned that they could hear the bed banging against the wall from the adjacent house. At the time, Mrs Cartwright explained: 'It was a metal headboard so it used to bang on the wall. 'There was no carpet back then, so when you have sex, the bed goes back and forward. 'If you get to a point where the bed's banging on the wall, you're not going to stop, are you? 'As far as I'm concerned, that's what you should be doing. Just relax. Go with the flow. It's not as if I'm having sex and think: ""Oh, I'm making too much noise. I better be quiet"".' Mrs Cartwright was initially handed a noise abatement order which was later upgraded to an ASBO after she breached the order five times. The ASBO forbade her from 'shouting, screaming and vocalisation' during sex or from playing loud music. Caroline Cartwright, from Tyne and Wear, was jailed for 12 weeks and handed a four-year ASBO for having noisy sex with her husband of 38 years, Steve. Neighbours complained about Mrs Cartwright's loud screams . Caroline and Steve (pictured together above leaving court last year) were visited by police countless times after neighbours complained their sex sessions were loud enough to drown out television programmes . However, in a bid to get around the restrictions, Mrs Cartwright switched her sex sessions to the morning leaving neighbours - who complained that she was noisy enough to drown out their TVs - less than impressed. 'I wasn't supposed to make excessive noise that could be heard in a neighbouring property or outside,' she explained. Mrs Cartwright was later arrested and admits she was even having sex with her husband Steve when police arrived to take to her into custody. The 53-year-old was taken to court, handed an eight-week suspended prison sentence and forced to live in a bail hostel for weeks. A year later, and after scores more complaints and visits from the police, she was again arrested for breaching her ASBO following two police callouts in two days. Again, she was handed a suspended sentence, this time for 12 weeks, and sent to live in a bail hostel where she was held alongside serious criminals, including murderers. However, despite her convictions, Mrs Cartwright, who has since bought a less noisy wooden bed, remains adamant that she's done nothing wrong. She said: 'I don't see why I should stop having sex in my own house with my husband of 38 years. 'I'm sure there could be a lot worse things I could be doing. They all thought it was stupid I was in prison. 'I mean I was in the same prison as people like Rose West for making a noise when I have sex. There could be a real crime going on while they're busy arresting me.'","Italian couple fined £9,000 for having noisy sex in San Martino apartment .

f5c2dc05f42f989b3a82d3640487f20ba26b23c8,"(CNN)At first blush, Brian Rogers and Caitlin McGuire seem like any other small business owners -- polite, hardworking and passionate about what they do. But there's the potential for things to get a little awkward when the conversation turns from ""hi""s to highs. ""There's always a moment of hesitation of 'when are they going to ask us what we do?' and 'how are they going to receive that when we tell them?'"" McGuire, 25, said. She and Rogers, 34, own the Breckenridge Cannabis Club, a recreational marijuana dispensary in the historic and scenic ski town of Breckenridge, Colorado. The couple started their business as a medical cannabis dispensary in 2010, but when Colorado became the first state in the nation to allow the sale of recreational marijuana, they saw a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity. Previously, they were only permitted to sell medical marijuana to the approximate 4,500 permanent residents of Breckenridge; when the new legislation took effect on January 1, 2014, they could then sell to any of the 30,000-plus tourists (21 years or older) who visited the town during peak season. By the end of the first day of ""recreational"" sales, they knew their lives had changed forever. The two said they brought in more than $47,000 in sales, roughly 30 times their normal daily sales of medical marijuana. The long lines and enthusiastic patrons also raised the ire of some of the residents who felt the shop detracted from the town's ""family-friendly"" atmosphere . Now, the pair's journey to build a legal marijuana empire is documented in the new CNN Original Series ""High Profits,"" which premieres Sunday, April 19, at 10 p.m. ET/PT. ""Somebody is going to become a mogul,"" Rogers said. In 2014, legal marijuana was a $700 million industry in Colorado and was billed as the fastest growing industry in the United States.  And, according to a a 2014 Gallup Poll, 51% of Americans favored legalizing marijuana, though that was down from the previous year's approval of 58%. It's a majority, but a slim majority -- and 23 states still prohibit marijuana outright. Here are the next states to legalize pot . ""We want to show people that it's not just a bunch of stoners selling pot over the counter,"" McGuire said. ""It's business-minded people -- hardworking Americans -- who are just like any other business and trying to make their dream work."" She and Rogers are simultaneously pragmatic and optimistic about the public's opinion. It's 2015: Is weed legal in your state? ""I think they often think we woke up and it was handed to us. Our job was created; we created our jobs through hard work and investment and risk,"" Rogers said. As pioneers in a newly legalized business, the risks Rogers and McGuire face go above and beyond those of your average small business. While the sale and private consumption of cannabis is legal in Colorado, the federal government still considers it a Schedule I controlled substance like heroin or LSD, a dangerous drug with ""no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse."" That classification makes it difficult for banks -- which are federally regulated -- to do business with marijuana retailers, even legal ones. Few even try. This is pot's $3 billion banking problem . And forget about paying for your pot with plastic. Like most Colorado cannabis stores, the Breckenridge Cannabis Club is a cash only business. Without access to banking, McGuire and Rogers are forced to pay their staff, their suppliers and even their taxes in cash. The two recognize that ""budtender"" might not be a career path any family expects their child to embark on, but for the most part, there has been surprising support: McGuire even got permission to use the remainder of her college fund to start Breckenridge Cannabis Club more than five years ago. ""For both of us, it was pretty easy to see this as a great opportunity to do something different,"" McGuire said. ""We were just working in the service industry so it's not like either of us had any full-fledged careers that we were afraid to leave behind or families that we were worried about risking or providing for."" What's worse -- pot or booze? Rogers' family used to tell his grandmother that he and McGuire ran a ski rental business. ""Then one day she was like, 'You don't rent skis, do you?'"" he laughs. McGuire had a similar experience with her grandma, until she came to the store for the first time and saw its legitimacy. ""She thought we were just your stereotypical drug dealers,"" she said. The couple says their grandmothers' attitude shift is what they're hoping for on a larger scale: While you may not agree with them, entrepreneurs in four states and the District of Columbia are out to prove that recreational cannabis and capitalism can coexist. ""We're cannabis consumers and we support that part of it, too. But that's not what this business is about,"" McGuire said. ""It's about having the opportunity to create a life for us and have a professional career that sustains us."" Will they succeed?

Bayern host the Portuguese side on Tuesday and Guardiola is confident the Bundesliga leaders will emerge victorious. 'I am completely convinced that my players will take their chances,' Guardiola said. 'I know which club I am at and know that (league) champions and cup winners is not enough. Only the treble is enough.' Pep Guardiola is targeting winning  three trophies with Bayern Munich this season .

Philipp Lahm will look to lead his team into the semi-final of the Champions League on Tuesday . Bayern remain on course for three trophies, leading the Bundesliga by 12 points and will meet Borussia Dortmund in the German Cup semi-final. The Bavarians won the treble under then coach Jupp Heynckes in 2013, just before Guardiola took over. The current Bayern boss also won the treble with Barcelona in 2009, when they became the first Spanish club to win the domestic league and cup as well as the Champions League in the same season. Ahead of the visit of Porto, Guardiola said on Monday that France winger Franck Ribery is highly unlikely to recover from an ankle injury in time to feature for Bayern. Ribery has been out for more than a month and Guardiola said it was more likely the player would miss the second leg of the quarter-final in Munich as the Germans look to recover from a stunning 3-1 defeat in Portugal last week. 'I do not think that Franck can play,' Guardiola told reporters. 'I will speak with the our doctor but my feeling is that he can't make it.' Guardiola's hopes of turning the tie around have been hampered by a string of injury absences, including to key players Arjen Robben, David Alaba, Javi Martinez and Medhi Benatia. Bastian Schweinsteiger is also fighting to get fit in time for the game and Guardiola said the Germany captain would train with the team late on Monday for the first time. 'I do not know who will play or who can play. In the past months, I always decided on my lineup an hour before the game.'

Xabi Alonso (left) gestures during Bayern's training session on Monday . Guardiola insisted he is confident his team will overturn the scoreline against Porto on Tuesday . 'Bastian Schweinsteiger will today train again for the first time and the more players I have the better,' Guardiola added. The Spaniard, who wore a T-shirt made by the family of an Argentine journalist killed in a car crash at last year's World Cup, said his team would try everything to overturn the first leg deficit despite the injury problems. 'It makes no sense to be on the pitch if you don't want to turn it around. We want to turn it around,' he said.","Porto beat Bayern Munich 3-1 in Champions League quarter-final first leg .

But the Apple Watch Sport model has been to shown to shatter easily after being dropped from a height of just under four feet (1.2 metres). Apple claims its watch, which has an Ion-X glass display, is 'protected by a lightweight aluminosilicate glass that's especially resistant to scratches and impact.' Scroll down for video . Smash: The Apple Watch Sport edition is shown to shatter easily (pictured) after being dropped from a height of just under four feet (1.2 metres). The model has an Ion-X glass display which is supposed to be 'resistant to scratches and impact' In a video, TechRax drops the 42mm timepiece from a height of four feet (1.2 metres) to simulate what may happen if a wearer drops their watch while tightening or unfastening the strap. When TechRex dropped the watch ‘not aiming at the display,’ in a test conducted in Sacramento, California, it survived unscathed despite a nasty ‘crack’ noise when the timepiece hit the pavement. However, when the watch was dropped so the display hit the floor first, the screen shattered with beads of glass seen on the ground after impact. In the video he exclaims: 'Are you serious Apple? That wasn’t even that bad. That was about three-and-a-half feet!' Deep impact: When online tester TechRex dropped the watch ‘not aiming at the display,’ in a test conducted in Sacramento, California, it survived unscathed despite a nasty ‘crack’ noise when the timepiece hit the pavement. However, when it landed on its face (pictured), it smashed instantly . The watch has 'high performance' rubber straps and the screen is held in an anodised aluminium case, that's 60 per cent stronger than standard aluminium, but is just as light. The Apple Watch Sport (pictured) has high performance' rubber straps and the screen is held in an anodised aluminium case . The tester added: ‘I found it amazing that the amount of shatter that occurred was so tremendous.' When he threw the watch down with force, the screen came off completely. Damage to the screen, such as chips, scratches or indeed shattering,  is not covered by the watch's warranty and is expensive to fix, MacRumours reports. Damage eligible for warranty service includes debris under the screen, a loose back cover and condensation in the heart rate monitor sensor windows. MacRumours also discovered that in the US owners will have to pay repairs fees of $229, $329 and $2,800 for the Sport, Watch and Edition models respectively to fix a cracked or missing crown, missing buttons,or screen damage, for example. It is not known how much these repairs will cost in the UK and other regions and MailOnline has contacted Apple for comment. By comparison, the Apple Watch, which costs from $549 (£479) and Apple Watch Edition from $12,000 (£8,000) have different screens made of Sapphire glass. In a recent test, repair specialists in Cardiff showed that the 38mm Sapphire screen remained scratch-free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer.

But some early adopters of the Apple Watch have complained its stainless steel case scratches easily, according to 9to5Mac. The 316L steel used is cold-forged to be 'extra hard', but it seems to scratch in a similar way to the back of an iPod. But it's not all doom and gloom for Apple Watch owners. Another test has shown that the Sport model does live up to Apple's waterproof claims. Unhappy: Some early adopters of the Apple Watch have complained that its stainless steel case (pictured) scratches easily, much like the back of an iPod . Waterproof: But another test has shown that the Apple Watch Sport lives up to Apple's waterproof claims after surviving 15 minutes in a swimming pool (shown above) Apple's CEO, Tim Cook previously said that he showers wearing his Apple Watch and Apple said the Sport edition has an IPX7 water-resistance rating, which means it can be submerged up to 3ft (1 metre) underwater for 30 minutes. And a team at FoneFox in Australia has shown that the watch cannot only withstand a long, soapy shower, as well as being submerged in a bucket of water for five minutes, but can also be left in a swimming pool for around 15 minutes,9to5Mac reported. While the screen couldn't be used while in the pool, because of the capacitive screen technology, when it was fished out afterwards it functioned as normal. The team found that the Crown still worked underwater, allowing them to zoom in and out of apps. The sapphire glass screen in the Apple Watch has remained scratch-free after being subjected to being rubbed with sandpaper, keyed and even hit with a hammer. The test was carried out by Cardiff-based iPhone repairs specialist iPhoneFixed.co.uk, which used a sapphire screen from a 38mm Apple Watch for its experiment. Two out of the three models of Apple Watches have sapphire glass screens - the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition. The glass is made from synthetic sapphire, which is created by applying heat and pressure to aluminium oxide powder, before the crystals are processed to remove impurities. The tiny round disks created are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass. Sapphire glass is said to be twice as tough as normal glass and almost as hard as a diamond. To test the durability of the screen, it was rubbed against a stone wall and then with a coin, before being ‘scratched’ by a key. The video capturing the attempts at destruction, shows no scratches were achieved to the screen. It also withstood being rubbed with abrasive sandpaper at some force and hit by a hammer – albeit not very hard. But most impressive, was the screen’s ability to withstand an electric drill being dragged across its surface, without leaving a mark. The test led iPhoneFixed to claim: ‘Sapphire glass is pretty strong and virtually impossible to scratch’.","Apple Watch Sport edition costs $349 (£299) and has an Ion-X glass screen .

336b63b875a52df0a12790025ee2a4f8908f31ef,"(CNN)Officer Michael Slager's five-year career with the North Charleston Police Department in South Carolina ended after he resorted to deadly force following a routine traffic stop. Slager, 33, has been fired, officials said Wednesday. His wife is eight months' pregnant and the city will continue paying for her medical insurance until the baby is born, North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey told reporters. He also has two stepchildren. His mother was interviewed by ABC News on Thursday. She told ABC her son loved being a police officer. ""I can't imagine him doing something that. ... It's not like him. That's just not his character,"" Karen Sharpe said. She told ABC she hasn't watched the video of the shooting. Slager initially told investigators that he used a Taser in a confrontation Saturday with Walter Scott, who was pulled over for a busted taillight. But Scott went for the Taser, according to Slager. A widely circulated video of the shooting death of the 50-year-old unarmed African-American man by the white police officer tells another story: Scott attempts to run. His back is to Slager, who, from a few yards away, raises his gun and fires. Slager is now charged with murder. The FBI is involved in the investigation of the slaying of the father of four. ""Shots fired and the subject is down,"" Slager said moments after the shooting, according to reports. ""He took my Taser."" Slager was proficient with the nonlethal Taser. According to personnel records, he scored 50 out of 50 on a Taser certification exam in 2011. Before the officer starts firing at Scott, the video shows a dark object falling behind him and hitting the ground. It's not clear whether that is the Taser. Later in the video, when Slager approaches Scott's body, he drops a dark object next to the man. Again, it's not clear whether that's the Taser. It's unknown whether Scott took the officer's Taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body. Slager was named in a police complaint in 2013 after he allegedly ""tased a man for no reason"" before slamming him to the ground and dragging him, according to the North Charleston Police Department. At the time, Slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5-feet-5-inches tall. The African-American man he confronted was 6-feet-3 inches tall. A lawyer for the man who filed the complaint, Mario Givens, said his client plans to file a lawsuit. ""The citizens of North Charleston shouldn't have to live in the fear,"" the lawyer, Eduardo Curry, told reporters Thursday. Givens said Slager came to his door, ordered him out of the house and then tased him. ""It was painful,"" he said. ""I fell. I have a couple bruises."" Slager was later cleared in that incident. ""I was upset,"" Givens said. ""They took a real long time to even investigate the case."" In another complaint in January, Slager was cited for failing to file a report after an African-American woman called police because her children were being harassed. Slager had worked as a waiter before joining the military, records show. He served in the U.S. Coast Guard from 2003 to 2009, according to a job application filed with the North Charleston Police Department. That application, filed in January 2009, said Slager had not been convicted of a felony in the past seven years. Personnel documents describe Slager as ""enthused"" when he joined the force and said he demonstrated ""great officer safety tactics"" in dealing with suspects. South Carolina senators, governor condemn police shooting . Slager's annual in-service mandatory training included a range of topics from first aid to firearms and Taser use. Slager passed his certifications. In August, Slager passed a firearms qualification. From 2009 to 2014, Slager qualified in the use of his Glock firearm. He received and passed yearly training in ""bias based profiling"" and ""ethics,"" the documents said. He also was certified by the S.C. Criminal Justice Academy in March 2013 as having ""met and successfully completed the in-service requirements"" as a law enforcement officer. Slager completed a separate 10-hour ""active shooter incident response training"" course in December 2013. According to the documents, Slager was involved in a ""nonpreventable"" traffic accident last year when a motorist with his car in reverse struck the officer's patrol car.  The driver fled the scene. Since graduating from the police academy in 2010, a supervisor twice noted in training reports that he ""spoke with (Slager) in reference to certain procedures in reference to conducting motor vehicle stops and citizen contacts."" No other details were provided. Slager signed his oath of office with the police force on March 1, 2010, pledging to ""faithfully serve the citizens of this city"" and ""never abuse my authority either by words or acts."" ""I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or violence,"" the oath said. Who was Walter Scott?

6ed4b69cba1ff7b4a5a3c37128266a8e0a596ddf,"Binge drinking might seem like a uniquely modern phenomenon - but in fact it is a time-honoured tradition, according to health experts. Ancient civilisations such as the Romans, Greeks and Egyptians have had to deal with rowdy, drunken behaviour in public for thousands of years. Now one academic suggests that modern authorities should take a lead from their forebears as they attempt to mitigate the impact of our boozy culture. Party: This relief from Herculaneum shows Bacchus, the god of wine, with followers at a frenzied gathering . Contrast: Health experts have compared ancient nights out to modern drinking spots such as Magaluf . Mark Bellis, who is honorary professor of public health at Bangor University, is giving a talk at a conference in Las Vegas this week about the history of binge drinking. In his lecture, entitled 'Lessons from the history of nightlife - 10,000 years from Mesopotamia to Vegas', he will examine how our distant ancestors balanced freedom with responsiblity in regulating nightlife. He told the Independent: 'We think we're discovering the problems of nightlife for the first time, but these have been with us for a long time. 'There's always been a tension in history: people want a safe night out, but they also demand freedom and an element of anonymity.' Vessel: A Greek amphora which could have been used for holding the wine which was drunk in large quantities at feasts . Many of the concerns of the ancient authorities were strikingly similar to ours, according to Dr Bellis. In Pompeii - where one of the best-preserved buildings after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius is a tavern - city officials installed street lights, only to face opposition from drinkers who were worried about sacrificing their privacy. The Greeks launched wide-scale campaigns to dissuade drunkenness, with playwrights using gods in their productions to warn against alcohol abuse. And in Egypt, one of the major concerns was mixing drink and drugs, as many locals would consume a narcotic flower called 'blue lotus' while knocking back beer, Dr Bellis says. He told the Independent: 'People look for an escape from the social and behavioural constraints of the day. That's what night has always been about.' The official preview of his talk, set to take place tomorrow, reads: 'The foundations of modern nightlife go back thousands of years to when people first abandoned nomadic lives to build and live in cities. 'Since then, countless cultures have added their own innovations and regulations in attempts to balance safety and security with excitement and anonymity. 'Looking back at how nightlife developed over the past 10,000 years, we can learn from history's successes and failures and develop a greater insight into the challenges posed by nightlife today.' The use of alcohol goes back to the Stone Age, and almost all societies around the world have made some sort of drink - despite the problems that come with a booze culture. Some of the earliest written texts, from Mesopotamia, make reference to alcohol - the law code of Hammurabi, from 1750 BC, contains regulations stopping tavern landlords from ripping off their customers. The Epic of Gilgamesh shows the eponymous king promising to distribute beer and wine to his followers 'like the new year celebrations'. Many aspects of Greek culture were centred around drinking - one of Plato's best-known texts is the Symposium, set at a huge drinking party, while wine even had its own deity in the form of Dionysus. However, to avoid excess drinkers were advised to water down their wine with water, and to drink more water between each cup of alcohol. Warning: Gin Lane, by William Hogarth, graphically depicted the dark side of booze culture . The Roman love of drinking is shown by the preserved city of Pompeii, where one of the buildings buried by volcanic ash in the eruption of Vesuvius appears to have been an inn. Rowdy feasts were also part of Anglo-Saxon society, as seen in the epic poem Beowulf, which could be a cautionary tale as it features the monster Grendel carrying off warriors who were tired out from a night of carousing. The Islamic world attempted to eliminate the problem of drunkenness with a religious ban on alcohol, but there are signs that this did not always work. The 900-year-old Persian poem known as the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam opens with an appeal for 'a jug of wine, a loaf of bread' to accompany an idyllic and romantic landscape. One tactic used to tackle alcohol abuse was to substitute less strong drinks instead of spirits - for example, in the Georgian era William Hogarth published two prints contrasting the hellish 'Gin Lane' with the relaxed and peaceful 'Beer Street'.","Health expert Mark Bellis says alcohol abuse goes back as far as ancient civilisations such as the Greeks and Mesopotamians .

1dba634e0daaeca708214dc8a9c882b6fe90538e,"The official word from Arsenal is that Jack Wilshere is not for sale at the end of the season. Not to Manchester City, not to anyone. Wilshere is one of Arsenal’s own, a product of the fabled Hale End academy and an example to young recruits that it is possible to make a first-team breakthrough. The reality is that Wilshere will sit with his influential father, Andy, at the end of the season to discuss whether a move to City would enhance his career and not just his bank balance. Jack Wilshere takes on Stoke's Charlie Ward during the Arsenal U21s game at the Emirates on Tuesday night . Wilshere was making his first appearance for the Gunners since recovering from ankle surgery . Wilshere has not featured for the first team since he was injured against Manchester United on November 22 . The England midfielder lays on the Old Trafford turf dejected after he suffered an ankle injury . Whatever manager Arsene Wenger has to say before Arsenal’s clash with Burnley on Saturday, Wilshere to Manchester City, as revealed in Sportsmail on Wednesday, is undoubtedly in the works. He is on the list of Txiki Begiristain, City’s director of football. At 23, he is a young English player who could bring down the average age of this City squad — if they could prise him from the Emirates. It will not be easy. Wilshere has always maintained that he wants to remain at Arsenal for the rest of his career. City, though, offer a fresh start and it is possible that Wilshere needs a change of environment after another frustrating season on the sidelines. England manager Roy Hodgson has preferred to deploy Wilshere in a defensive role for the national team . Manchester City have snapped up several players from Arsenal in recent times, with varying degrees of success. GAEL CLICHY . Transfer fee: £7m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 1 FA Cup (2005). Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 13-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: Decent deal . KOLO TOURE . Fee: £15m. Arsenal: 1 Premier League title (2003-04), 2 FA Cups (2003, 2005). Man City: 1 Premier League title (2011-12), 1 FA Cup (2011). Verdict: Decent deal . EMMANUEL ADEBAYOR . Fee: £25m. Arsenal honours: none. Man City honours: none. Verdict: bad buy . SAMIR NASRI . Fee: £24m. Arsenal: none. Man City: 2 Premier League titles (2011-12, 2013-14), 1 League Cup (2014). Verdict: top transfer . BACARY SAGNA . Fee: free. Arsenal: 1 FA Cup (2014). Man City: none. Verdict: decent deal . It is also a well-trodden path for Arsenal players in recent seasons, with Emmanuel Adebayor, Samir Nasri, Gael Clichy and Bacary Sagna leaving the rhythmic, first-touch football at the Emirates for super-sized salaries at City. It is not an easy decision, particularly with the vulgar salaries on offer at the Etihad and the inevitable accusations of being a mercenary, but this is key moment in Wilshere’s career. The midfielder is already paid handsomely — £130,000 a week all in when he starts for Arsenal — but injuries are a constant source of frustration for Wilshere. He has not played a first-team game for Arsenal since November 22, when he was substituted 55 minutes into the 2-1 defeat by Manchester United at the Emirates with an ankle injury. In the past, Wilshere has been built up too soon, championed as a future Arsenal and England captain when he has yet to even make 100 starts for his club in the Barclays Premier League. Even former England captain Steven Gerrard claimed he had the ability to become one of the best midfielders in the world before he played Brazil at Wembley in February 2013. ‘Jack’s got a bit of everything. He can tackle, pass, get up and down the pitch, create a goal or score a goal,’ said Gerrard at the time. ‘He ticks almost every box, and he’s going to get better and better. He has the potential to become one of the best in the world. ‘I don’t want to put any pressure on him, but having played against him and seen him in training, he’s a one-off. He’s a lot better than your normal Premier League midfielder.’ The truth is that Wilshere needs time, room to breathe again after being championed ever since he scored that magnificent goal for Arsenal’s reserve team against West Ham at Barnet’s Underhill Stadium in 2008. Wenger was there that night, grinning with approval in the stands after the 16-year-old’s curling left-foot effort confirmed his status as one of the club’s rising stars. He earned instant comparison to Liam Brady. Gael Clichy (left) and Samir Nasri are just two Gunners who have left for Manchester City in recent seasons . Arsene Wenger's side are currently second in the Premier League and face Burnley on Saturday . Since then Wilshere has made the grade with the first team, an established member of a core group of players who are enjoying the club’s soothing possession football. On present form Arsenal are the best team to watch in the Premier League and Wilshere, recovering from his latest injury, would dearly love to be part of it. Although dad Andy is a West Ham fan, his son is Arsenal through and through, as he demonstrated after last season’s dramatic victory over Hull City in the FA Cup. During the victory parade, just hours before he joined up with the England squad to begin preparations for the World Cup in Brazil, he mischievously grabbed the microphone to ask the fans: ‘What do you think of Tottenham?’ The answer was well-publicised at the time, but the more pertinent question is whether Wilshere can reclaim his first place in this developing Arsenal team. Wilshere could struggle to break into a side containing Alexis Sanchez (left) and Mesut Ozil next season . With England, manager Roy Hodgson plays him at the base of his midfield diamond, but at Arsenal Wenger prefers him in a pairing behind the main attackers. With Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey the favoured attacking players behind Olivier Giroud, this is not an easy team for Wilshere to get into next season. At 23 he has time on his side and even at the end of this season there are still three years to run on his current contract. Soon enough there will be a decision to be made for all concerned.","Jack Wilshere has been linked with a move to Manchester City this summer .

Newcastle United defender Gutierrez, who successful underwent treatment for testicular cancer earlier this year, was given a standing ovation at Anfield when he was introduced as a second-half substitute during his side's 2-0 defeat by Liverpool on Monday night. Falcao managed to catch up with Gutierrez and posted a picture of the pair on his Instagram account stating: 'It was a pleasure to spend time with @elgalgojonas ,a great example of bravery and a great person'. Radamel Falcao (right) spent his Thursday evening in the company of Jonas Gutierrez . Manchester United striker Falcao walks through Alderley Edge in Cheshire on Thursday afternoon . The on-loan forward has been linked with Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and Valencia in recent weeks . Falcao replaced Marouane Fellaini in the 83rd minute during United's 4-2 rout of Manchester City . The Colombia striker moved to Old Trafford on a season-long loan from Monaco last summer but has struggled to hit the heights he achieved before suffering a serious knee injury. United will have to pay £46million to make Falcao's transfer permanent but, having only scored four goals all season in 22 appearances for the club, his future with Louis van Gaal's side is looking increasingly uncertain. The former Atletico Madrid striker is currently commanding £280,000 a week in wages and had to suffer the ignominy of playing for United's Under 21 team in March.

And now a new poll on modern families reveals this is a reality for almost a quarter of Britons – who said their pet dog was more important to them than their in-laws. Of the 2,071 people surveyed, 22 per cent cited their pets as a close family member, above in-laws (21 per cent) but below grandparents at 26 per cent. Scroll down for video . A new poll on modern families reveals almost a quarter of Brits prefer their pets to their in-laws . The research commissioned by Matalan for its Made for Modern Families campaign also found that the ‘Brady Bunch’ or ‘blended’ household where children had multi-parental figures was also on the rise. More than one in 10 British families now live in ‘blended’ families as more people with children divorce, remarry other parents and their households merge. As a result a fifth of all children – more than the entire population of Birmingham and London combined - have participated in their own parents’ wedding, the poll found. Spending quality time together as a family is still important with 65 per cent saying eating together at a table was one of their favourite family activities and 30 per cent claiming to enjoy playing board games and doing arts and crafts together. Over a third (35 per cent) said that their family’s happiness was their top priority, compared to just 6 per cent who cited money as most important. Mark Earls, a leading behavioural expert and fellow of the Marketing Society, said: ‘Contrary to those who have bemoaned the decline of the family as a key pillar of our society, family is alive and well – it just comes in many more different shapes and sizes than it used to including the “blended’ or “Brady Bunch” family, which consists of one or more adults with their own children and those from previous relationships. The interfering mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as most people’s least favourite family member, as in 2004 film Monster-in-Law starring Jane Fonda and Jennifer Lopez . ‘More than one in ten British families have this kind of arrangement. Such a scenario can create a situation in which the age gap between the youngest and eldest child/step-child can be more than a decade, as our survey found. ‘Ultimately, what we want for our families is what we’ve always wanted for those we love - health and happiness. However much the shape and the structures and the participants shift, it seems these same old truths abide. The family is here to stay.’ While the Beckhams were seen by 20 per cent of people questioned as the best representation of the modern family, 16 per cent thought it was Jamie Oliver’s brood, followed by the Jolie-Pitts at 7 per cent. Next in line from the list were Will Smith’s family (4 per cent) and Elton John and David Furnish (3 per cent). The research saw data compiled by YouGov reviewed by Mr Earls for Matalan as part of its commitment to understanding today’s modern families. Jason Hargreaves, Managing Director of Matalan, said: ‘Family life has changed dramatically since we first opened our doors 30 years ago. The demands on parents and families are greater than ever as time is precious, life is faster and pockets are pinched. ‘Family is at the heart of our business and we are committed to being there to help families, whatever their makeup or wherever they’re from, in everything we do.’","Mother-in-law is often jokingly portrayed as least favourite family member .

Dale Lyman, a spokesman for the Greeley Fire Department, says firefighters were called to the site northeast of Greeley airport shortly after 1 p.m. They are working with NGL Energy Partners, the company that owns the site, but had to wait for the explosion risk to subside so they could use fire suppression foam to extinguish the fire, Lyman told The Greeley Tribune. Nearby homes were evacuated, however no injuries were reported. The fire began when lightning struck a water storage tank, launching it into the air. It landed 60 feet from the site. The water contained traces of hydrocarbons and petroleum as a result of hydraulic fracturing, which ignited, Fox 31 reported. The tanker  was near an injection well where fracking wastewater is pumped into the ground. Scroll down for video . Boom: A tanker carrying fracking wastewater - which contains traces of gas and petroleum - exploding at a facility in Greeley, Colorado, on Friday, after being struck by lightning in a storm. No one was injured, but the facility has likely been destroyed .

Launched: An oil and gas wastewater tank soars through the air after an explosion at the NGL Energy Partners facility Friday . Plume: Smoke rises as a fire spreads at a waste water storage area on Friday near the Greeley-Weld Airport outside of Greeley . The area was linked to earthquakes near Greeley in May and June last year. The site is located near the intersection of Weld County Road 47 and Weld County Road 64, just northeast of the Greeley Airport. The suppression foam that used to extinguish the flames is for fighting liquid fire l and cuts off the fire’s oxygen supply and cools it down, Lyman said. NGL Energy Partners have several similar facilites across the country. The company's vice president, Doug White, said they had the incident under control. 'It was quite a lightning storm that was moving through here,' White told The Greeley Tribune. Explosion: Flames erupted about 1 p.m. at the site located near the intersection of Weld County Road 47 and Weld County Road 64, just northeast of the Greeley Airport in Colorado . Fracking site: The fire was near an injection well where hydraulic fracturing wastewater is pumped into the ground . Burning for hours: Firefighters had no choice but to sit back and wait for some of the fires to subside, because they were ignited by oil . Greeley added: “We’ve had it happen in Texas, several times, actually. 'That’s a part of the business.' While some local reports have suggested the facility was completely destroyed in the fire, White played down such talk. 'We don’t know the amount of damage,' he said. We’re still assessing the situation.' In a statement, company officials also vowed to participate fully in the investigation. Colorado wasn't the only party of the country battered by severe weather this weekend - or the only place a tanker exploded. Karnes County Sheriff Dwayne Villanueva blamed lightning for an explosion Friday at an oil tank in Karnes City, south of San Antonio, sending flames more than 100 feet into the air. Storms featuring high winds, hail and at least one report of a tornado swept through an area stretching from southern Texas to parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and central Nebraska on Saturday, and more were forecast later in the evening.

57bb2d1a9f2cb5e2ac7f5dae066030f68790d2a9,"The sequel to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series has been shrouded in such secrecy the novel is being written on computers with no internet connection to avoid any leaks. The Girl In The Spider's Web, published worldwide on August 27, will be the fourth installment in the best-selling Millennium crime trilogy by Swedish author Stieg Larsson. The book was completed in November by David Lagercrantz based on a plot outline left by Larsson before he died of a heart attack in 2004 aged 50. Mr Lagercrantz, known for co-authoring Swedish football star Zlatan Ibrahimovic's autobiography, said the publishers have gone to extreme lengths to keep the novel under wraps. However, Norstedts did yesterday reveal that it kicks off with an artificial intelligence intrigue involving a U.S. spy agency. Under wraps: The sequel to the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo series by Steig Larsson (left) entitled The Girl In The Spider's Web (right) has been shrouded in such secrecy it is being written on computers with no internet . The 500-page sequel takes up the story of tattooed computer hacker Lisbeth Salander and journalist Mikael Blomkvist, whom she helps solve a murder mystery  in the first book in the series. Mr Lagercrantz said he, the editors and translators were subject to similar kinds of espionage-style secrecy, reportedly working on computers disconnected from the Internet to avoid leaks. He told the Dagens Nyheter daily: 'If you write about Lisbeth Salander its easy to get a little paranoid. 'You realise what opportunities there are to hack computers. 'It was a little awkward. 'Every time I needed to Google I had to do it on another computer. And we used code words - like our own little spy world.' Its British publisher, MacLehose Press, which has unveiled the front cover showing Salander with her dragon tattoo and wearing punk trousers, said they have given strict instructions to follow suit. Taking up the mantle: The book was completed in November by David Lagercrantz (above) based on a plot outline left by Larsson before he died of a heart attack in 2004 aged 50 . Christopher MacLehose told The Guardian: 'The Swedish original publishers Norstedts have put everyone on notice that no particle of this book can be shared with anybody. 'There'll be no review copies in any language before it's launched on 27 August... nobody will be in a position to beat the ring of steel around this book.' The novel is called Det som inte dödar oss in the original Swedish - or What Doesn’t Kill You - but given a different title for the English version. It is being translated into 38 languages. Setting the scene, Norstedts publishing house wrote on its website: 'One night professor Frans Balder, a leading authority within AI (artificial intelligence) research, calls up Blomkvist. 'Balder says he has world-shattering information on U.S. intelligence services... had contact with a female super hacker, who bears a certain resemblance to a person Blomkvist knows well.' Saddened: Eva Gabrielsson has said Larsson would have been 'furious' about the release of The Girl In The Spider's Web, the fourth book in the Millennium series which began with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo . Until now the publishers had remained tight-lipped about the plot, only saying that it would continue the story of the trilogy's heroine, which has sold more than 75 million copies worldwide. The book has been given the blessing of Mr Larsson's estate, but not from his long-term partner. Eva Gabrielsson said last month that the journalist, who co-founded the anti-racism magazine Expo in Sweden, 'would be furious' if he knew someone else was writing his story. Gabrielsson, who lost a bitter battle with the late author's family to manage his work, added that Lagercrantz was 'a totally idiotic choice' as he lacked Larsson's left-wing activist background. Norstedts have compared the planned release on August 27 of the book in at least 35 countries to the global splash made by Dan Brown's sequels to the 2003 'Da Vinci Code'. At the time of his death, Larsson reportedly had plans to write at least another seven novels.","The Girl In The Spider's Web is fourth installment in Stieg Larsson's series .

81c6658dff79c94096f9f0defda8ccdf13815e48,"Polls yesterday suggested the election will be too close to call – with the Tories narrowly ahead in two, while another showed Labour edging in front. The news came as an American pollster – who predicted the results of the 2008 US presidential election almost exactly – concluded that both main parties will struggle to cobble together any kind of workable majority. The latest ICM poll for the Guardian had the Tories ahead on 34 per cent – down five points from a week ago. Labour were down one point on 32 per cent. Nate Silver, who correctly predicted the winner in 49 of 50 US states in 2008, believes that neither Labour or the Tories will be unable to get enough support together for a majority government . Meanwhile a new Populus poll found Labour unchanged on 34 per cent, while the Tories were down one, on 32 per cent. In a third poll, Lord Ashcroft found a Tory lead of four points – with the party on 34 per cent compared to Labour's 30 per cent. Pollster Nate Silver, who correctly called the winner in 49 of 50 US states in 2008, yesterday predicted a hung parliament after May 7 with the Tories winning 283 seats and Labour 274. This means that both David Cameron and Ed Miliband could find it almost impossible to secure enough support from other parties for a working majority – let alone rule on their own. Paddy Power said Mr Miliband is now more likely than Mr Cameron to be prime minister after the election . Mr Silver said Labour, who have ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP, would also be short of a majority even with the help of the Scottish Nationalists, whom he expects to gain 42 seats . Mr Silver said that even if the Tories join forces with the Lib Dems – who he believes will win 27 seats – they would still be 13 short of the 323 MPs needed for a majority. With Ukip expected to have only one MP in the projection, Nigel Farage would not be able to offer much help – and even with the support of eight Democratic Unionist Party MPs from Northern Ireland, Mr Cameron could not achieve a majority. Mr Silver said Labour, which has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP, would also be short of a majority even with the help of the Scottish Nationalists, who he predicted will gain 42 seats. That would give Mr Miliband 316 seats – seven short of a majority. He would then have to try to gain support from smaller parties such as Plaid Cymru, the Greens and Northern Ireland's SDLP – but as they are projected to win only six seats between them, Labour would still be one short of the necessary 323.","Nate Silver predicts the Conservatives will win 283 seats and Labour 274 .

'When he turned around to put it back on the bulletin board, she turned her neck, her whole head trying to follow and find the picture again.'

Jade and Aaron Badland asked an Asian family if they had Ebola and assaulted a Brazilian hotel employee, calling her a 'bloody foreigner'. The pair have been spared jail after a court heard that they were too drunk to remember what they had done at the Premier Inn at Stansted Airport. Assault: Aaron and Jade Badland have admitted assaulting a hotel worker after their wedding reception . Mr Badland, 24, a bomb disposal officer in the Engineering Regiment, was wearing his Army uniform during the drunken attack alongside his 29-year-old bride. Both newlyweds pleaded guilty to assault and were each ordered to carry out 80 hours of unpaid work, while Mrs Badland was also found guilty of racially aggravated harassment. Chelmsford Magistrates' Court heard that the couple got married in Malta last August, but held their wedding reception at Audley End, Essex in November. Afterwards they were staying at the Stansted branch of Premier Inn, where American guest David La Plante saw them abusing an Asian family. He told the court: 'Around the corner by some lifts we heard talk and the wife was making derogatory remarks to the family, calling them foreigners and asking if they had the Ebola virus. 'I positioned myself between her and the family and gave her a look saying ""enough is enough"". She asked me if I had the Ebola virus and my response was, ""Do you?"" 'Her husband came around, wrapped her up and told her we were Americans and not to talk to us.' Venue: The assault took place at a branch of Premier Inn in Stansted Airport, pictured . Harry Coleman, prosecuting, told the court that the Badlands staggered to their hotel room but could not work out how to use the electronic key. They then confronted Brazilian worker Christina Periera, but Mr Badland became angry when she told them she would have to reprogramme the key in order to open their door. Mr Badland then told Mrs Pereira: 'It's my room, open the f***ing door - bloody foreigners coming to our country.' Mr Coleman said: 'Ms Periera was upset and said she was going down to call the police, and he hit her on the nose with his open palm and again twice more.' Mrs Badland 'prodded' the worker with two bottles of alcohol as her husband continued to shout, the court heard. She told magistrates: 'I had a lot of drink. I had a good few pints and some shots and don't remember anything about the incident because of the level of intoxication. I was very drunk.' Gareth Hunter, mitigating, said the couple were 'ashamed' and Mr Badland would be disciplined by the Army. Mrs Badland was ordered to attend a 10-day education, training and employment programme and pay £625 costs and £60 victim surcharge, while her husband was told to pay £100 compensation and a £60 victim surcharge.","Jade Badland and her husband Aaron were drunk after wedding reception .

The authorities drove the naked, bloated corpses of the four alleged terrorists around the town in a pickup truck from the mortuary to Garissa Primary School. It comes as survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding in a wardrobe and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued after al-Shabaab gunmen stormed Garissa University College on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Paraded: The naked bodies of the alleged attackers were driven around Garissa before the pickup truck parked at a primary school . In the primary school playground, hundreds gathered to look at the bodies of the men accused of being the attackers . Hundreds of people, some grieving for the loved ones they lost in the siege, gathered in the sweltering heat to catch a glimpse of the men who are believed to be responsible. Pictures of the crowds and the bodies piled onto the vehicle are being shared on social media. Four attackers died at Garissa, but they have not been named and their nationalities have not been revealed. It was hoped that crowds viewing the corpses might identify them. 'I want to see them,' Muna Haji told The Washington Post. 'I want to know that these people are dead. They have killed innocent people.' Survivor Ms Cheroitich, who hid under a pile of clothes, spoke about her ordeal following her rescue today. She was initially too petrified to come out of the wardrobe, but a lecturer she knew eventually convinced her that police officers were not the al-Shabaab gunmen - 50 hours after the barbaric attack began. Kenyan troops searching the building were alarmed when they heard sounds coming from inside a wardrobe. A police officer said: 'She kept asking for reassurance from the security forces they were not al-Shabaab before she could come out. 'She was given milk and rushed to the Garissa hospital, where she is being observed before being given counselling.' Speaking later in hospital, the survivor said she told officers from inside the wardrobe: 'How do I know that you are the Kenyan police?' 'I was just praying to my God,' Ms Cheroitich, a Christian, said. A crowd gathers outside the morgue to catch a glimpse of the corpses of the alleged terrorists who killed 148 . Members of the public gather outside the mortuary window to view the bodies of the alleged attackers in the mortuary . People gather to catch a glimpse of the bodies of the alleged terrorists at the hospital mortuary in Garissa . This picture of a classroom strewn with dead bodies has emerged revealing the true horror of the massacre . Four other survivors from the massacre at Garissa University College were found yesterday. A photograph from inside one of the classrooms at the university has emerged, showing at least 12 bodies strewn across the floor, which is covered in blood. At least three people appear to have been huddled in fear in the corner of the room when they were murdered by the militant Islamists. The terrorists raided the university early on Thursday morning, overwhelming guards and murdering people they suspected of being a Christian. A total of 148 people were killed in the siege, with the gunmen shooting and beheading those who could not recite the Koran. Most of those killed were students but two police officers, one soldier and two watchmen are among the dead. Kenya's interior minister, Joseph Nkaissery said the four terrorist gunmen had strapped themselves with explosives. When officers shot at them, they exploded 'like bombs' and shrapnel injured officers. Kenyan security officials said dozens of hostages were freed and four of the gunmen, believed to be armed with AK-47s, were killed. Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, emerged after two days of hiding inside wardrobe at the university, and was initially too petrified to believe police officers were not al-Shabaab gunmen . Today survivor Cynthia Cheroitich, 19, who spent two days hiding and drinking body lotion to survive, was rescued . The Interior Ministry said five suspects had been detained, some while trying to flee to Somalia, where al-Shabaab is based. Four were Kenyans of Somali origin, and the fifth was Tanzanian, the ministry said. Officials said all three were associates of Islamist teacher Mohamed Mohamud, who is believed to have masterminded the attack. There is a £145,000 bounty on his head. The interior ministry said the three suspects arrested at the border had coordinated the attack. Two people were detained at the university, including a security guard and a Tanzanian man. 'We suspect the Tanzanian, who was hiding in the ceiling, was one of the combatants,' ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka said. 'He had ammunition with him when he was arrested on Thursday night. We suspect the guard facilitated the entry (into the university).' In a chilling warning today, the terrorist group said more attacks like the university massacre were planned. 'Kenyan cities will run red with blood,' al-Shabab said in a statement, according to the SITE intelligence monitoring group.

Relatives are reunited with their loved ones who survived the attack (centre) at Nyayo stadium in Kenya's capital Nairobi . A woman who survived the attack (centre) is reunited with relatives at Nyayo stadium in Nairobi today . The militants said the barbaric attack was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia. 'This will be a long, gruesome war of which you, the Kenyan public, are its first casualties. 'No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety, thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath.' Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said today that those behind the attack were 'deeply embedded' in Kenya, and called on Kenyan Muslims to help prevent radicalisation. 'Our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities,' he said in a televised speech. 'Radicalisation that breeds terrorism is not conducted in the bush at night. It occurs in the full glare of day, in madrasas, in homes, and in mosques with rogue imams.'

A North Carolina man's obituary asked two things of friends and family: instead of sending flowers for the funeral, give the money to charity. And don't vote for Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2016. The family of 81-year-old Larry Upright added the political message to the obituary announcing the Kannapolis man's death and burial this week. Upright's daughter, Jill McLain, said the rock-ribbed Republican was passionate about politics. She says that recollection prompted his family to ask obituary readers to reject Clinton's presidential bid, not necessarily to spark controversy. 'We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad,' Jill McLain told WSOC-TV. Mike Upright said his deceased father voiced his opinions regularly. 'We did this for him,' Mike Upright said. 'We know he's up there giggling right now. Just laughing out loud.' The obituary also describes Upright as an active member of local Masonic and Shriners organizations and a country club. He retired after a career in the building automation industry. For their dad: 'We did it solely to do something nice and honorable for our dad,' said his daughter Jill McLain . Meanwhile, a group of Nevada sex workers have come out in favor of the Democratic contender.

f17f5102e0dee44a93b6f0238594f532b2eef1da,"The National Football League has hired its first female ref, Sarah Thomas, according to a report. Thomas, 42, a referee for college football's Conference USA, has been considered before for a position in the NFL before she was chosen to start in the league next year, Baltimore reporter Aaron Wilson posted on his Twitter account. She has previously refereed preseasons games, scrimmages and minicamps after becoming part of the NFL's training program since 2013. Sarah Thomas, a 42-year-old mother of three from Brandon, Mississippi, has reportedly been tapped as the first woman to be hired as a full-time NFL referee. Above she officiates a preseason New Orleans Saints game . The Conference USA official became the first woman to officiate and FBS game in 2007 and the first to preside over a bowl game in 2009 . The NFL would not confirm Thomas's hiring on Friday, saying in a statement: 'The 2015 roster of officials has not yet been finalized. When it is, the new officials for 2015 and the entire roster will be announced.' Thomas will be among eight new hires made for the 2015 season, a source close to the matter told the LA Times. A Brandon, Mississippi, native, Thomas played basketball at University of Mobile before beginning officiating after attending a meeting with her brother. 'He told me there’s a bunch of old men sitting there. And that I might get some strange stares,' she told the Hattiesburg American last year. 'When I walked into that meeting sure enough that did happen.' She reffed basketball and high school football before moving on to college and becoming the first woman to officiate a FBS game in 2007 and the first to preside over a bowl game in 2009. 'The thing is, I've never set out to be the first and that hasn't changed, she said in 2013. 'I do this because I love it.' The mother of three credits her success in sports to being raised with brothers. The Mississippi native first began officiating after attending a meeting with her brother and credits her family with helping her succeed in the sports world . Though Thomas is tabbed to be the first full-time woman hire by the NFL, Shannon Eastin became the first female to officiate a game in the league when she was a replacement ref in 2012 . She also works as a  pharmaceutical sales representative, and says she doesn't wear the makeup she wears at her day job when she's on the gridiron,  according to Gulf Live. Shannon Eastin technically became the first woman to officiate an NFL game in 2012, when the league hired replacement refs while in negotiations with the officials' union. However, she stopped working for the NFL after owners reached an agreement with the regular officials. If Thomas begins reffing regular season games, the NFL would become the second major American sports league to have women officials, after the NBA. Violet Palmer and Dee Kanter were hired by the basketball league in 1997. Kantner was fired in 2002, though Palmer still regularly runs games in the playoffs. The NBA hired another female ref, Lauren Holtkamp, last year. Women umpires in baseball have only reached the Triple-A and preseason game levels. Female refs are common in the WNBA. Violet Palmer, NBA . Violet Palmer referees a game between the Orlando Magic and the Denver Nuggets in January of this year . Violet Palmer is the longest-serving female referee in any of American sport's four major leagues. She was first hired by the NBA in 1997 and has continued officiating men's basketball to the present day. Palmer later continued trailblazing, becoming the first woman to ref a playoff game in 2006, between the Indiana Pacers and the New Jersey Nets. Beyond breaking ground for her gender, she also publicly announced that she was lesbian in 2014, shortly after Jason Collins became the first NBA player to come out as gay. Dee Kantner, NBA . Dee Kanter, was hired the same year as Violet Palmer as an NBA ref but left after several seasons. Above, Kantner stands next to North Carolina Tar Heels coach Sylvia Hatchell at a 2013 womens's NCAA game . Dee Kantner joined the NBA officiating staff the same year as Palmer, but was fired after the 2001-2002 season. In a statement about her firing, the league said that she was 'not making sufficient progress in her own development'. Kantner said that she was 'stunned' by her letting go and that she had been given no warning about the decision. She worked as the supervisor of officials in the WNBA before going to the men's league, a role to which she has since returned. The long time referee has also consistently officiated women's college basketball. Lauren Holtkamp, NBA . Female NBA ref Laura Holtkamp, who  is completing her first season in the NBA this year, discusses a call with Denver Nuggets player Ty Lawson in November . Laura Holtkamp, 34, became the NBA's third female referee in 2014 after . She played basketball at Drury University in Missouri and had plans to get a master's degree in divinity at Emory in Atlanta before being drawn to refereeing. She soon became reffing women's college games as well as WNBA and NBA D-League matches, according to Grantland. Her first year in the league has not been without controversy. Los Angeles Clippers point guard Chris Paul was criticized by many for alleged sexism when he said 'this might not be for her,' after he was given a technical fowl by Holtkamp. Pamela Postema, MLB Spring Training . Female MLB umpire Pamela Postema calls balls and strikes behind the plate at a a Kansas City Royals game in 1992 . Pamela Postema was not the first woman to umpire a professional baseball game, with her first innings come five years after Bernice Gera sued Major League Baseball to preside over a minor league contest in 1972. However, Postema became a fixture in the professional games everywhere but 'The Show' in the 1980s. She spent seven years in Triple-A, the league directly below the majors, and even made it to spring training games in 1988 and 1989. However, she was controversially fired in 1989 after the death of MLB commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, who had been considered supportive of her career. Postema filed a sex discrimination lawsuit after the firing ended her well-regarded career, which was settled out of court. Ria Cortesio, Minor League Baseball . Ria Cortesio, pictured at a Double-A game between the Jacksonville Suns and the Montgomery Biscuits in 2007, was fired the same year . Ria Cortesio was the face of female umpiring in baseball for many years in the mid-2000s. She spent nine years in the minor leagues, with the highest being the Double-A Southern League, according to the Houston Chronicle. Cortesio was also the first woman since Postema to umpire an exhibition game when she worked a spring training match-up between the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks. She also worked the Home Run Derby at the 2006 All-Star Game in Pittsburgh. Her umpire rating in Double-A slipped during the 2007 season and she was let go in the autumn of that year, according to ESPN. Shannon Eastin .

Shannon Eastin became the first woman to officiate a regular season NFL game in 2012 when she was used as a replacement ref in the September 2012 game between the St Louis Rams and the Detroit Lions. Regular officials were locked out by owners during a 2012 dispute, a replacement refs were used until an agreement was reached at the end of September. She had previously officiated the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference college games and high school games before being hired by the NFL.

The controller of BBC Radio 3 has branded audiences ignorant and claims broadcasting classical music has become more challenging as a result. Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job in an interview on Radio 4's Feedback programme. Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago – not consistently so, anyway. 'We have to perhaps offer more explanation and context for works. 'It's not lowering the standard, it's not making the content simple. It's about how we present it.' Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.' The station has been accused of 'dumbing down' in the past, especially after a drive in 2011 to make it more 'accessible' to a broader audience. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright (above) dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down . With just two million listeners, Radio 3 is the least listened-to of the BBC's main stations. Last year Mr Davey's predecessor Roger Wright dismissed as 'complete nonsense' claims that the station was dumbing down and said there were distinct differences between the stations. He said: 'I just don't recognise it at all. Apparently we do phone-ins? We don't. 'We haven't had a request show for a long, long time. You do hear one listener voice on the breakfast show suggesting a piece of music — that's not exactly a phone-in. So it's complete nonsense.'","Alan Davey controversially laid bare the difficulties of the station's top job .

5cd7548fbb6ac00c0ddfdcc2d4dab1cbc9b3765a,"Victims of a man who operated a 'revenge porn' website and then charged victims to remove nude images and their personal information spoke out after the man was sentenced on Friday. Kevin Bollaert, 28, was sentenced to 18 years in state prison after he was convicted in February of 21 counts of identity theft and six counts of extortion in San Diego Superior Court for running a pair of websites that capitalized on the internet as a forum for public shaming. A group of Bollaert's victims were flown in from around the country to be involved in the prosecution and some have now said that they no longer feel ashamed for sending nude pictures. Victims revealed that they had received a slew of hurtful comments after their nudes were posted and one woman even said she nearly killed herself. Scroll down for video . Shameful: In a first-of-its-kind ruling, Bollaert was sentenced t 18 years for running a 'revenge porn' site, publishing nude and embarassing photos of women sent in anonymously by people wanting to hurt them . Standing up: Three victims, Emily (left), Natlie Coco (center) and Megan Borash (right) spoke out on how having their pictures and information posted on the website affected them . Jilted lovers and hackers could anonymously post nude photos of people without their consent, along with personal information about them, at a website Bollaert created and moderated, called ugotposted.com. More than 10,000 images, mainly of women, were posted between December 2012 and September 2013. People who sought to have the explicit images taken down were directed to changemyreputation.com and charged $250 to $350 to remove the racy content. Victims included teachers, wives and professionals. Nicole Coco was one of the victims who testified in court. She told NBC that after receiving vulgar messages from strangers she went to the police but they were not much help. 'I got the photos removed once. The second time they were like, 'We'll try and try again.' They thought it was my fault, and it was a lot of victim shaming,' said Coco, who had previously tried to commit suicide because of the situation. She said that a California Department of Justice official who contacted her with regards to criminal charges against Bollaert was the first time she was told and felt that having the pictures posted was not her fault. Crying in court: Kevin Bollaert, 28, broke down in tears at his sentencing hearing in San Diego on Friday. He was facing a maximum of 20 years but was given 18, with the judge saying the sentence accurately reflected the amount of victims he hurt . Shaming: Victim Natalie Coco said she had been through a lot of victim shaming before being contacted by a California Department of Justice official who had reached out in regards to criminal charges against Bollaert . 'It was amazing because I blamed myself for a long time before that,' she said. Another victim of Bollaert's website, Megan Borash, said that when the guilty verdict came in she knew was she did 'was not wrong' and that she was 'not ashamed of what' she did. Borash said that the sentencing 'means a lot'. 'Huge weight off my shoulder. I'm out here talking to you, gave you my information. Ask me yesterday, you wouldn't have gotten it. It's time for me to take my life back and start living.' The landmark case was the first time a person had been tried for a running revenge porn ring in the United States. The compromising photos cost people jobs, damaged relationships and led to one attempted suicide. Bollaert earned about $900 a month in website ad revenue and collected about $30,000 from victims. Relief: Victim Megan Borash said that after the guilty verdict came in she realized that what she did was not wrong and that she was 'not ashamed of what' she did . Trauma: One victim, who identified herself as Emily, said that she had received 'crude comments' about her body after pictures of her were posted on the site . Bollaert's lawyer had claimed at trial that the business was gross and offensive, but he didn't break the law by allowing others to post the explicit material. 'It's gross, it's offensive, but it's not illegal,' Emily Rose-Weber said. But the prosecution said Bollaert terrorized women and enjoyed doing it. Not only would he the photos, but the names, addresses and social media details of the people in them. Many victims were inundated with harassing messages from strangers. Investigators found that Bollaert received thousands of distressed emails from victims, one who said she was 'scared for my life' and another who said she'd been 'getting nonstop harassing messages.' The criminal complaint named more than two dozen people as victims, one of whom claimed she was thrown out of her home after her family found out nude photos had been posted of her. 'It ruined my life and I'm still going through it,' she testified. 'I lost my family. They think that I brought shame on them. My reputation is ruined.' Some of the women read victim impact statements in court, according to NBC San Diego. Ruined: In spite of the thousands of emails he got begging to have photos taken down, Bollaert told investigators it was his life that had been ruined by the site . One victim, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's just broken me on a level that's not describable. The only thing I have left is shame and anger.' Mashable reported that Bollaert, in an interview with agents from the California Department of Justice's eCrime Unit, explained the site was 'just, like, ruining my life.' 'Yeah, I realize like this is not a good situation,' Bollaert said according to the complaint. 'I feel bad about the whole thing and like I just don't want to do it anymore.' 'I mean I know a lot of people are getting screwed over like on the site. Like their lives are getting ruined,' he said. Criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor Tony Solare told NBC that 'revenge porn' cases are hard to prosecute. 'It's hard to prove someone did the act if they did it through a computer. Unless you can prove someone did it with that IP address they can say I didn't do this. I can sit here and think of a million ways people can commit this crime without getting caught,' he said. Terrorized: Some of the victims appeared in court, anonymously, to read victim impact statements. Many said their lives had been irrevocably ruined by Bollaert and his site . Convicted: Kevin Bollaert, 28, was facing 20 years after being found guilty of extortion and identity theft for running a despicable scheme for victims to pay to have their images removed from his revenge porn site . He added: 'As far as the volume of [cyber-exploitation crimes] I'm sure [investigators] are woefully understaffed as far as what's out there.' Solare also said that people who think they're victims of cyber exploitation should take a series of important steps. He said: 'If you have a situation like that, you want to sit down and write a detailed account of what occurred, who did it, why you think they did it, what information you can have to specifically tie the bad act to the person you think did it and how you found out about it. 'Because the more information someone has, the more law enforcement has, the more they have to look into it. 'The other thing to do is to not delay in reporting something like this because any delay in reporting of any crime creates any problem for prosecution,' Bollaert is expected to serve at least half his prison sentence and must pay $10,000 in restitution. The trial of Hunter Moore, called 'the most hated man on the Internet' for running isanyoneup.com, is yet to go before court.","Kevin Bollaert was found guilty of 27 counts of identity theft and extortion .

The newspaper reported that Weber's flight experience goes back decades: he flew in both World War II and the Vietnam War, and also served as a Korean War flight instructor. All told, Guinness World Records says on its website that 'Peter has been a pilot for 72 years.' According to Guinness, Weber was a flight cadet in 1943. 'Peter went on to become a Lieutenant Colonel in the US Air Force,' the website says. 'He retired from the Air Force in 1970, and since then has flown for recreational purposes.' Weber pulled off his March 30 flight at the age of 95 years and 143 days, Guinness says. Weber told the Sacramento Bee in March 'The reason I did it is because I though maybe I might have the record be - being the fact my age is 95 years, 4 months and 23 days.' Years of experience: Weber reportedly was a flight cadet in 1943 and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in 1970 (March 2015 file photo) At the time, he said that Guinness recently made a new category for the oldest qualified pilot who still has a license and flies alone while speaking to the newspaper.

cad6a4bde24b000a645cef663b5480e9a47b2d14,"A set of stone flakes shaped more than 3.3 million years ago could be the world's oldest tools created by early human ancestors, according to researchers. Archaeologists have revealed that they have discovered 20 stone flakes and anvils - used to help shape the tools - just west of Lake Turkana in Kenya. The discovery could fundamentally change the current view of human evolution as - if correct - the date of the stone tools is 700,000 years older than any others found previously. The stone tools were discovered buried in sediment along the west coast of Lake Turkana (above) in Kenya . It means that ancient human ancestors were creating tools hundreds of thousands of years before the appearance of the first 'man' - the start of our branch of the evolutionary tree known as Homo. Many experts have long believed that it was the use of stone tools by early species of Homo like Homo habilis and Homo erectus that helped set them apart from other human-like species. 55 million years ago - First primitive primates evolve . 15 million years ago - Hominidae (great apes) evolve from the ancestors of the gibbon . 8 million years ago - First gorillas evolve. Later, chimp and human lineages diverge . 5.5 million years ago - Ardipithecus, early ‘proto-human’ shares traits with chimps and gorillas . 4 million years ago - Australopithecines appeared. They had brains no larger than a chimpanzee's . 2.8 million years ago - LD 350-1 appeared and may be the first of the Homo family . 2.7 million years ago - Paranthropus, lived in woods and had massive jaws for chewing . 2.3 million years ago - Homo habalis first thought to have appeared in Africa . 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster begins to appear in fossil record . 1.6 million years ago - Hand axes become the first major technological innovation . 800,000 years ago - Early humans control fire and create hearths. Brain size increases rapidly . 400,000 years ago - Neanderthals first begin to appear and spread across Europe and Asia . 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens - modern humans - appear in Africa . 40,0000 years ago - Modern humans reach Europe . Scientists behind the discovery now believe ancient species known as Australopithecines - typified by the fossilised skeleton called Lucy - or Kenyanthropus made the tools. Professor Sonia Harmand, a palaeolithic archaeologist at Stony Brook University in New York who led the team that discovered the tools, said they stumbled across them by accident. The team had been searching for the site where a controversial human relative called Kenyanthropus platyops had been discovered in 1998. But after taking a wrong turn they came across another area and spotted what looked like stone tools on the sandy surface. Professor Harmand, who was presenting her findings at the annual meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society, said: 'The artifacts were clearly knapped [created by intentional flaking] and not the result of accidental fracture of rocks.' The tools were found at a site known as Lomekwi 3, just west of Lake Turkana in Kenya. By excavating down into the sandy soil, the team discovered a series of sharp stone flakes and cores - the rocks the stones are knocked off. They also found anvils that were apparently used to hold the cores as the flakes were struck off. In one case the team were able to fit a flake back to its original core. A further 130 stone tools were discovered on the surface. Each of the stones showed distinctive patterns that suggest they had been struck and shaped by human ancestors. As some tools were locked inside sediment left behind by the receding desert lake, the researchers were able to accurately estimate the time when they were dropped there. By tracking changes in the Earth's magnetic field recorded in the sediment, the researchers were able to pinpoint the date to 3.3 million years ago. This skull of Kenyanthropus platyops was found close to the site of the stone tools in 1999 close to Lake Turkana in Kenya and may be the species responsible for creating the stone flakes that have been discovered . This stone tool - known as an Olduvai chopper - on display at the British Museum is around 1.8 million years old was thought to be one of the earliest examples of stone that had been used by ancient human ancestors . These early stone tools found in Ethiopia are thought to be around 1.7 million years and were used as choppers . This is close to the date of another piece of controversial evidence found in 2010 that suggested stone tools were used long before the appearance of the Homo species on Earth. Researchers working in Dikika in Ethiopia - where an Australopithecine child was discovered- reported they had found cut marks on animal bones dated to 3.4 million years ago. Their claim that these had been made by human ancestors using tools were hugely controversial. Now the latest discovery is the strongest evidence yet that these early humans did have ability to make and use tools rather than being primative creatures. Until the recent discovery, the oldest stone tools to be discovered were in Gona, Ethiopia and were thought to have been made by early Homo species - possibly Homo habilis. The stone tools were discovered buried in sediment at a site called Lomekwi on the coast of Lake Turkana . The stone tools may have been made by relatives of 'Lucy', a female Australopithecus afarensis that lived 3.2 million years ago who is shown above in a reconstruction at the Houston Museum of Natural Science in Texas . Recent discoveries have suggested that the Homo genus first began around 2.8 million years ago, but the tools discovered at Lake Turkana are 500,000 years older than that. As they were found close to the site where Kenyanthropus platyops was discovered - which some say was actually a species of Australopithecine - it suggests they made the tools. Professor Harmand, whose team are preparing a paper on the discovery for publication in the journal Nature, told the Paleoanthropology Society that the Lomekwi 3 tools had been created by 'knappers with a developing understanding of the fracture properties of stone'. She said they were made using simple hammer techniques and combined battering the stones to break of flakes and a technique called core reduction. She said: 'The Lomekwi 3 tools mark a new beginning to the known archaeological record.' According to Alison Brooks, an anthropologist at George Washington University in Washington DC, the finds are 'very exciting. She told the journal Science: 'They could not have been created by natural forces.' that the She added that technology shown in the tools may have actually played a major role in the emergence of our genus - Homo. Dr Simon Underdown, an anthropologist at Oxford Brookes University, described the research as 'exciting'. He said: 'It’s important to remember that the first stone tools we can recognise as manufactured . objects are very unlikely to have been the first tools used. 'Organic material like wood or bone rarely preserves in the archaeological record and the first stone tools would have looked very like lumps of broken rock (lacking the detailed patterns we see with later stone tools). 'This new research is incredibly exciting as it pushed back the date for tool making by almost a million years which in turn means tools were being used even earlier than that.' This fossilised jawbone with teeth still in place is thought to belong to the earliest member of the Homo genus 2.8 million years ago but this is still 500,000 years short of the time when stone tools were being used .","Archaeologists have found 20 stones shaped by early humans using 'simple techniques' close to the west shore of Lake Turkana in Kenya .
The tools are thought to be 500,000 years older than the first Homo species .
They are also 700,000 years older than other stone tools found previously .

1b8e20fba71989a0dfca2cb9ee2e23905c4358a6,"The diversity of life on Earth is increasing despite dire warnings that the planet is facing a mass extinction, a leading writer has claimed. Stewart Brand, president of the Long Now Foundation and editor of the Whole Earth Catalogue, believes the focus on widespread extinctions may actually be harmful. Instead he argues it is highly unlikely that the planet is facing a sixth mass extinction as many threatened species are recovering. This chart shows the increase in marine biodiversity from the fossil record and the five mass extinction events . His views are likely to be controversial with conservationists who have been warning that human activities risk killing off a large proportion of species on Earth in an event to rival the extinction of the dinosaurs. Mr Brand, who campaigns for long term solutions to the world's problems rather than short term policy decisions, said that the rate of discovery of new species was currently outstripping the loss of species to extinction. 1. Indonesia - 184 . 2. Madagascar - 114 . 3. Mexico - 101 . 4. India - 94 . 5. Brazil - 82 . 6. China - 73 . 7. Malaysia - 70 . 8. Thailand - 55 . 9. Australia - 55 . 10. Peru - 54 . Writing for Aeon, he said: 'Viewing every conservation issue through the lens of extinction threat is simplistic and usually irrelevant. 'Worse, it introduces an emotional charge that makes the problem seem cosmic and overwhelming rather than local and solvable.' Instead he argues that the trends for conservation are actually 'looking bright' as depleted ecosystems are being enriched and damage in others is slowing. He said: 'The five historic mass extinctions eliminated 70 per cent or more of all species in a relatively short time. That is not going on now.' Mr Brand points to recent research by the ecologist Mark Costello at the University of Auckland who found that the number of new species being recorded was now at around 18,000 a year. They said that the current extinction rate of one per cent of species per decade was far lower than the discovery rate of three per cent per decade. Fossil records also indicate that biodiversity in the world has been increasing for the past 200 million years and is now at its highest level ever. The black rhino, pictured, was considered to be one of the most endangered species in the world and intensive efforts have been made to help conserve the species and its numbers are slowly beginning to rise again . Major efforts to remove rats from Codfish Island in New Zealand has allowed the kakapo (above) to recover . Mr Brand also points to the efforts that have taken place on many islands around the world - where species are most vulnerable to extinction. He said that schemes to eradicate invasive species like rats and goats had been hugely successful and allowed many island species to bounce back. He also pointed to the example of cod, which the ICUN Red List describes as being threatened with extinction, but many cod fisheries are now recovering. Mr Brand, who is also a campaigner to reintroduce extinct species such as woolly mammoths and passenger pigeons, believes biotechnology could also help to bring other species back from the brink by allowing their genetic diversity to be improved. Sumatran orangutans (pictured) have a population of just a few thousand as their forests have been destroyed . He said that some wild animals are moving back into areas where they have long been absent by themselves. Salmon for example have moved back into the Rhine, Seine and the Thames as the water has becoe cleaner. Wolves, lynx and brown bears are also spreading in many parts of Europe. He said that even with climate change, it is unlikely that all of the 23,214 species currently deemed as threatened with extinction would die out. Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species. The map above shows the countries with the highest number of threatened mammals in the world . There are more than 1.5 million known species in the world. Mr Brand said he did not believe climate change is likely to have much impact on the loss of wildlife as many species will evolve and adapt to cope. He said: 'My own prediction is that climate change will be deemed intolerable for humans long before it speeds up extinction rates, and even if radical steps have to be taken to head it off, they will be taken.'","Writer Stewart Brand says warnings that the world is facing a new mass extinction may lead to a fatalistic attitude that will do more harm than good .

New indie music was first piped into the cabin - during boarding and disembarking - a few months ago and has quickly become a hit with passengers. In fact, many have taken to Twitter to share their approval of the new on board playlists, which feature rockers such as The xx, Haim, Phantogram and Hozier. American Airlines is targeting a younger demographic with the introduction of their new 'indie' cabin playlists . According to BuzzFeed News, on an internal blog, American Airlines representative, Barbara Delollis, discussed the company's decision. 'For 2015, they sought out a style of music that's upbeat yet not distracting, helps American stand out from the competition and appeals to younger generations,' she wrote. And it takes a lot for a track to make the cut. According to Delollis, the songs aren't just those 'you might find on the iPad/Spotify of a Gen Xer or Millenial. Foster The People is just one of many indie rock bands that are included on American Airlines' new playlists . Tracks from Hozier (left) and Lykke Li (right) were also hand selected to be played on board the flights . While boarding and while disembarking, specially selected indie rock music will now be piped into the cabin . The change comes on the heels of unfavourable customer feedback about the airline's previous cabin music, which were instrumental piano versions of pop songs. Brian Richardson, senior manager of American's in-flight entertainment and connectivity, also shared his thoughts about the switch on the same internal blog. 'The instrumental versions of pop songs had become tired and people were ready for a change,' he added. One Twitter user was especially excited to hear one of her favourite bands, Phantogram, on board . Washed Out, or Ernest Greene, is an electronica singer-songwriter and record producer from Georgia . Hozier's Take Me to Church was one of the biggest songs of the year - and can now be heard on board . Phantogram (left) and The xx (right) are two of the featured artists on American Airlines new cabin playlists . One customer mused that boarding his American Airlines flight felt like heading into a trendy nightclub . For this Twitter user, the best part of his flight was the boarding music playlist - and arriving safely, of course . Some passengers aren't totally excited about the change, like this man, who liked the previous elevator music . He also shared his excitement about seeing customers on board take out their smartphones and use the Shazam app to identify the songs playing. 'Who would've thought that we'd be introducing some people to these indie artists?' he wrote. The indie music is paired with the airline's new state-of-the-art cabins and, so far, all mainline and some regional aircraft have adopted the in-flight playlists.

When Sally Lutkin decided to have her grandchildren's names tattooed on her leg, she imagined ending up with a beautiful, life-long reminder of her loved ones. Instead, she was left with a gruesome black hole and a lasting scar in the middle of her calf, after being rushed to hospital for emergency surgery. Mrs Lutkin, 49, had a rose surrounded by the names grandchildren Harvey, seven, Harvey Junior, six, and Cooper, one, tattooed above her left ankle in November 2013. But the tattoo quickly became so swollen that she was in agony and couldn't walk, forcing her to rush to A&E. Doctors carried out emergency surgery to stop the infection spreading to her bone. She was left with a bloody hole resembling a gunshot in the middle of her rose design, as well as an unsightly scar she will have to live with for years. Mrs Lutkin, of Kingston upon Hull, East Yorkshire, said: 'It really upset me because it's something that I wanted just for me - and it really didn't turn out that way. 'I was in the hospital for a week and it was so difficult because it's the longest I've ever been away from my babies. 'They had to operate before the infection spread down to the bone and I don't know what would have happened if they had not caught it earlier. 'The pain was horrendous - it was indescribable. I was in agony and the swelling was so bad that I couldn't walk.' Her daughter Laura, 28, noticed that the tattoo was turning red the day after the needle work was complete. But Mrs Lutkin, who works as a cleaner, dismissed it as a normal part of the healing process. She was horrified when the symptoms worsened and her leg began to swell until she could no longer walk. Her  husband Peter, 57, a labourer, rushed her to hospital and she remained there for a week while she battled the nightmare infection. Mrs Lutkin, who has five children, admitted that even 18 months later she is still feeling the effects of the infection. Mrs Lutkin wanted a tattoo of a rose and her grandchildren's names (Harvey, seven, is pictured, left). But it became infected and after an emergency operation she was left with a gruesome hole in her leg (right) She has been left with a scar even 18 months after the ordeal, and has vowed never to have another tattoo again in her life . She said: 'I still get aches and pains from it but I just have to get on with my life. 'We're a really close family and they were shocked. 'It was a hard thing for them to see me in so much pain, especially for my eldest grandkids. 'It ruined Christmas because I couldn't go out Christmas shopping and all the little ones wanted to put the decorations up - in the end, my kids had to put them up for me.' The ordeal forced her to abandon plans to add the names of one-year-olds Lottie and Harper - who were born within six days of one another - to the body art. And, with another grandchild on the way, Mrs Lutkin insists she is not tempted to tamper with ink any more. She said: 'It's put me off for life. I'd had tattoos before but I'll never have one again. 'I won't even risk getting the tattoo removed. 'No one is laying their hands on me ever again after this.'

Ryan Calhoun and Delonte Martistee, students at Troy University, were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators, according to a statement from the Bay County, Florida, Sheriff's Office. The Troy, Alabama, Police Department found video of what appeared to be a Panama City gang rape during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting. The video was turned over to the Bay County Sheriff's Office. The Bay County Sheriff's Office Criminal Investigations Division has identified the victim in the video but said state law prevents the office from releasing any information about her. She was a visitor in Panama City. ""We are not releasing her location or any additional information on victim to protect her from further trauma,"" said sheriff's spokesman Tommy Ford. After interviewing witnesses, Bay County investigators determined the alleged rape took place sometime from March 10, 2015, to March 12, 2015, behind Spinnaker Beach Club, a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers. A statement from Troy University confirmed the two men are current students. ""The students have been placed on temporary suspension from school per the university's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures. Martistee, a member of the track and field team, has also been removed from the team."" The investigation continues and more arrests are expected, the Bay County Sheriff's Office said.

A fourth person has been arrested over the alleged murder of a Syrian imam who was shot dead in his car on a London street. Police announced today that they had arrested a 36-year-old man on suspicion of conspiracy to murder Abdul Hadi Arwani, who was killed in Wembley two weeks ago. A Jamaican businessman has already appeared in court charged with Mr Arwani's murder, while a man and a woman were arrested this week on suspicion of terror offences. The father of six, who was an imam at a controversial mosque in west London, was found dead in his black Volkswagen Passat on April 7. Leslie Cooper, 36, appeared at the Old Bailey on Thursday, where the court was told that Mr Arwani, 48, was lured to a meeting with a potential customer for his construction business before being killed. Burnell Mitchell, 61, the brother of Boney M's lead singer, was arrested this week on suspicion of conspiracy to murder and the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. A 53-year-old woman was also arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. They are both in Metropolitan Police custody while counter-terror officers continue to investigate Mr Arwani's killing. Police said in a statement today that they had arrested the fourth suspect, a 35-year-old man, on Friday, before releasing him on bail today.

3d6c3f8e7ed92d4f34fbe3ef2c7913c7df708960,"It’s been just over three years since Dana Vulin was set alight  at her Perth home, resulting in horrific third degree burns to more than 60 per cent of her body and countless operations to reconstruct her scorched face, arms and torso. Now the woman who turned her into a 'human fireball', leaving her unable to make simple movements such as straightening her elbows due to the agonising scarring, will argue her 17-year jail sentence was too severe. Lawyers for Natalie Dimitrovska will on Tuesday, in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, claim that Ms Vulin was not as badly injured as she stated in court, based on footage that shows her recovery filmed for Channel 7's Sunday Night program. Dimitrovska, who believed her former husband was involved with Ms Vulin and was envious of her beauty, vowed to ruin her ‘pretty little face’. She walked into Ms Vulin’s home on February 16, 2012, and hurled a bottle of methylated spirits over her setting her ablaze and changing the 29-year-old’s life  in every way imaginable. ‘I lost my enter life, I know that sounds huge but people don’t understand the enormity of not having my functionality, it’s my independence, my sexuality, my everything,' Ms Vulin told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Road to recovery: Dana Vulin suffered horrific third degree burns to her face and body. Using skin taken from her legs, doctors have reconstructed the 29-year-old's scorched skin over countless operations during the past three years. Ms Vulin has many more operations to come and still suffers greatly with functionality . During Dimitrovska’s original trial, in Western Australia’s District Court, Ms Vulin described how she 'was pretty much instantly on fire' during the attack. As she continues her long and painful recovery, spending most days in hospital and working with domestic violence and suicide prevention charities in her spare time, the dark prospect that Dimitrovska could be freed early looms. ‘I’ve been given a life sentence and she’s complaining about 17 years,’ Ms Vulin said. She found out a year ago that Dimitrovska was lodging an appeal to argue her sentence for grievous bodily harm with intent was ‘manifestly excessive’. ‘My understanding is she thinks it’s a sentence too long for what she has done. It’s just annoying I just want to move on and she’s already caused me enough pain, leave me alone,’ Ms Vulin said. 'I am accepting I’m always going to have scars, which is a necessity to move on': Almost three years on since her horrific attack, Ms Vulin spends most of her days in hospital still but is also working with charities . Lawyers for Natalie Dimitrovska (left and right) will on Tuesday claim that Ms Vulin was not as badly injured as she stated in court. They are appealing for her sentence to be reduced . She has ‘no idea’ if her attacker’s appeal will be successful however, as ‘it’s such a unique case, it’s unprecedented,’ Ms Vulin explained. Since the assault when she was 25-years-old, Ms Vulin spent two years and eight months wearing a compression mask to help put her face back together. ‘It made me feel like nothing of me was Dana, not the life I lived, the things I did and not the exterior. ‘I would have rather endured physical pain than wear that mask,’ Ms Vulin said. ‘It helped to shape the face and the pressure was so tight it helped flatten and massage the face and try to keep it from going inside out.’ The mask has now been removed but every morning when she wakes up she is stiff from her scars. ‘I am still in the early stages of recovery, I’m looking at least five years,’ she said. Ms Vulin spent two years and eight months wearing a compression mask to help put her face back together . 'I would have rather endured physical pain than wear that mask': Ms Vulin said as she looked back on the past three years since the heinous crime . ‘Physically I am accepting I’m always going to have scars, which is a necessity to move on. Yes I don’t look like anyone else but I’m damn proud about how far I’ve come and I’m as unique inside as I am outside.’ The Perth woman puts much of her progress down to her personality. ‘I was always strong. That is peoples’ biggest misconception about me. My looks were a bonus, I was strong in my heart and head before this… you’ve got to love who you are as a person because looks fade,’ Ms Vulin explained. However, she has countless more operations to come, with functionality prioritised over cosmetic procedures. Dana Vulin leaves court after watching the woman who set her alight and left her to burn to death jailed by a Perth judge for 17 years . Ms Vulin, seen here before the attack with her sister, was set alight by a jealous estranged wife of a man she had met once . ‘I’m a modern day Frankenstein… it’s absolutely amazing': Dana pictured here before the attack . ‘I’ve still got so much to work on. I can’t really bend my elbows or raise my arms. 'I’m stuck if I try to overstretch, I get a break down or wound because my skin is splitting,’ she explained. She spent Christmas and New Year in hospital having her new chest, shoulders and décolletage area operated on. ‘It failed the first time so I had to get it redone and it’s starting to scar again. They’ve taken skin from my right leg five times and my left leg four times,’ she said. ‘I’m a modern day Frankenstein… it’s absolutely amazing and the human body is beyond incredible. I am so eternally grateful for the doctors and physios at Royal Perth,’ Ms Vulin added. It would be very easy for Ms Vulin to be filled with hate about what happened to her but she insists ‘all I ever do is take positives’ from the situation. ‘I want my life back. I’m so grateful I’m alive, I can see, I can smell, I can touch. I still feel grateful. 'I want my life back. I’m so grateful I’m alive': Today Ms Vulin is looking at the positives to move forward . ‘I guess every day is a reminder but I try not to think that she did this me. I want to give it no power. I just have heartache and one step forward is ten steps backwards with the burns. ‘I’m used to disappointment now but I’m also used to getting back up and kicking it in the face,’ Ms Vulin said. As Ms Vulin continues on her recovery she is now working with the Men In Black suicide prevention charity, is an ambassador for the Kiss Violence Against Women Goodbye campaign and is also representing Lifeline WA in the 2015 HBF fun run as their official charity ambassador. ‘I try to get behind most charities but I guess with violence against women and the run it is all about a lifeline for healthy mind and healthy body, that's something I've experienced first hand through my recovery,' she said.

a9ebf2d18f8f3cbb97f7c33f502423271acc4ab8,"Veteran airman Andrew Danziger claims to have seen a UFO . A veteran pilot, who flew President Obama's campaign plane, has revealed that he has seen a UFO  flying through the sky. Andrew Danziger claimed that virtually all airmen believe in unidentified flying objects and that he had his own close encounter in the cockpit between Kansas and Iowa  in April 1989. The aircraft captain said the UFO initially appeared as a white disc before changing into a 'giant red ball.' The aviator, who has 28 years of cockpit experience, said the alien aircraft glowed bright red for around 30 seconds before disappearing below the clouds, according to the New York Daily News. Mr Danziger recalled that his plane had left Kansas City International Airport and reached the cruising altitude of 15,000 feet when he first saw a 'white disc' clearly visible through the clouds. He explained that the Captain of the aircraft, named only as Bruce, also spotted the foreign object that appeared similar to the moon. Despite, both of the men having a number of years of experience behind them they could not identify the mystery gizmo that was visible for around 40 minutes. As the pair began their decent into Waterloo, Iowa, Mr Danziger said the UFO suddenly changed colour. 'I yelled to Bruce, ""Holy s***,"" he told the newspaper. 'Above the clouds, where the white disc had been, was a now giant red ball.' He said the bright disc appeared to hover above the clouds . Mr Danziger, who flew Barack Obama during his 2008 election campaign, recalled the object flying in the same direction as his aircraft for around 30 seconds before it vanished like the 'setting sun.' The experienced airman said most pilots have reported similar sightings  (file picture) A series of flashing lights were then visible through the clouds, according to the pilot who has flown Boeing aircraft. The men later informed the National UFO Report Centre of the sighting and it was stressed to the pair that  countless pilots have witnessed similar objects in the sky. 'While neither of us had any idea what we had saw one thing we were certain of, it wasn't from here,' the North American Airlines captain told the New York Daily News. 'I'm not going too far out on a ledge to say that virtually all pilots believe in UFOs.'","Andrew Danziger flew President Obama during 2008 election campaign .

Former Arsenal striker Henry, now a pundit for Sky Sports, took exception to Hernandez celebrating 'like he'd won the World Cup' after scoring the winning goal for Real Madrid on Wednesday night, and said after the match that he owed everything to his team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo. The three-time World Player of the Year could have shot with two minutes to go in Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final second leg against bitter rivals Atletico, but opted instead to tee up team-mate Hernandez, who himself slotted the ball home to secure victory.

The pass can be just as important as the goal.'

It’s Ronaldo who chooses to change the course of the game. 'That is for me Ronaldo’s goal. There is two minutes to go, he didn’t want to take that chance because he knows Hernandez is in a better position so you have to play that ball.

Craig Davies bagged a brace after Eidur Gudjohnsen hammered the Trotters in front, with 62-time England international Emile Heskey proving his worth by laying on two assists. Cardiff dominated possession, but were undone far too easily by Neil Lennon's clinical side, who now have a 13-point buffer on those in the relegation zone. Eidur Gudjohnsen, pictured with fellow goalscorer Craig Davies, celebrates after scoring against Cardiff . Craig Davies fired a double to ensure his side claimed all three points at the Cardiff City Stadium .

Goals: Gudjohnsen 55, Davies 59, 73 . Booked: Vela . Referee: Keith Stroud . Attendance: 20,219 . An early Heskey chance sparked a spell of Bluebirds dominance that saw Josh Vela booked for a late swipe at Peter Whittingham. The City playmaker soon had a chance of his own after sparking a move that saw Craig Noone find him on the edge of the box, but his low drive flew just wide. Noone cut in from his left flank and fired just wide before the Bluebirds had their best chance to open the scoring. A Whittingham corner landed at the feet of striker Eoin Doyle, who spun and shot, but he was denied by Barry Bannan on the Bolton line amid cries of handball. Just when the Trotters seemed to be pegged back, they had a chance of their own when Dorian Dervite rose highest to meet Bannan's corner, but Alex Revell was on hand to head away the goalbound effort. Cardiff midfielder Aron Gunnarsson looks dejected during his side's 3-0 home defeat . Dorian Dervitte is challenged by Joe Ralls during the Championship encounter at the Cardiff City Stadium . Joe Mason replaced the injured Revell before Gudjohnsen slipped in Davies who curled a clear-cut chance just wide. And they were almost made to pay after Gudjohnsen fouled his Iceland team-mate Aaron Gunnarson on the edge of the box, but Whittingham bent the free-kick inches past the post. The Cardiff City Stadium was shocked into silence in the 55th minute when Gudjohnsen put the below-par Wanderers ahead. Heskey took the sting out of a strong pass with his chest to set up the former Chelsea and Barcelona man inside the 18-yard box, and he lashed a left-footed strike into the top corner. And it was 2-0 less than five minutes later, with Heskey providing the scoring pass once more. His assist found Davies charging down the left wing, and the striker powered into the box and cracked a low shot through the legs of Marshall and into the bottom corner. Cardiff fans streamed out of the stands when Davies put the contest well and truly to bed in the 73rd minute. He bagged his brace by once again darting off his left flank and past Fabio before he bent the ball around the Marshall into the same corner he had scored in 14 minutes earlier. And Davies could have got a hat-trick soon after when he broke clear of the Cardiff defence, but Marshall denied him with his legs.

bae8201fa542f26641a61429764b4aa9a1209c07,"Set in the grey stones of the Victorian chapel, the red of the two doors makes a bold, slightly unexpected statement. But that distinctive splash of colour is the only clue to the identity of the man who turned this building into a family home. In the early 1970s, Sir Richard Branson brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business. And from then until the present day, the Virgin logo – which has gone on to adorn trains, planes and a multitude of other businesses – has always been printed in the red of those humble chapel doors. Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire, into a home in the 1970s . At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel at South Leigh in Shipton-on-Cherwell, Oxfordshire. At The Manor, the first Virgin albums, such as Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells, were recorded and Branson would use The Old Chapel as a weekend retreat. Other artists using The Manor included Sandy Denny, The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band and John Cale. 'I saw Richard coming and going into The Old Chapel in the 1970s,' says South Leigh resident Martin Collet, 57. 'I often used to see him in the village pub, The Mason Arms, having a meal with family and friends and he was always very pleasant.' He brought the chapel into residential use while he was setting up his Virgin recording business . The entrepreneur painted the doors of the country retreat his trademark bright red, pictured with Kate Moss . He adds that The Old Chapel wasn't always a complete retreat from Branson's rock 'n' roll world. 'He often had parties there and we heard the music, even though we were four doors away – but it wasn't a problem. I think he only used the house at the weekends, and he was well liked in the village.' Other residents recall that Branson was a regular visitor to the village shop on Sundays, buying breakfast for his overnight visitors. Branson's love affair with this part of Oxfordshire continued after he left The Old Chapel. He owned The Manor until the 1990s and, for two decades, also owned Mill End House in the village of Kidlington, which he sold to his children a few years ago when he moved his base to Necker Island in the Caribbean. 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, who bought it in 2007. 'We haven't had to do much, apart from putting in solid oak flooring and new central heating with Victorian-style radiators.' The four-bedroom home is now on the market for £599,000. At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . The four-bedroom home is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout the building . The village of South Leigh is in the parliamentary constituency of Witney, Prime Minister David Cameron's seat – and the poet Dylan Thomas lived in South Leigh Manor in the 1940s. But the village has another claim to fame, one that relates to The Old Chapel itself. In 1725, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist Church, gave his first sermon in the St James the Great church in the village. It's fitting, then, that a century and a half later, 85 years after Wesley's death, the village came to have a Wesleyan Methodist chapel of its own – the very property that Branson would one day end up converting. Price: £599,000 . Location: South Leigh, Oxfordshire . Bedrooms: Four . Unique features: Converted by Sir Richard Branson; former Wesleyan chapel in the village where John Wesley gave his first sermon . At the time of his first sermon, Wesley was studying at Oxford University. The Jacobean pulpit in St James the Great bears a plaque commemorating the sermon, which is reputed to have lasted two-and-a-half hours. 'We were looking for a property in South Leigh as we had friends in the area,' says recently separated Rowan, 50 – a management consultant with two children, Jacob, 15, and Nancy, 13. 'We fell in love with the house the moment we saw it.' Rowan only found out Branson had been a previous owner on his second viewing. 'That undoubtedly increased our interest, especially when we realised what an excellent job he had done converting it into a home, without losing too many of its original features,' said Rowan. 'And the house ticked all the boxes for us. It has lots of space and is conveniently located for the A40, with good access to London.' At the time he converted the property, Branson had a recording studio in an old manor house a few miles away from the chapel . 'Branson did a superb job on the chapel,' says Rowan Andrews, the home's current owner, pictured is the kitchen . The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden . The building is divided into two levels and exposed beams run throughout it. Features that Branson added include pine banisters and large round windows offering views across surrounding countryside. The property has an en suite and family bathroom, and the master bedroom overlooks the back garden. A studio room could be used as an office or fifth bedroom. The main sitting room is spacious, with a fireplace and woodburner, and the open-plan dining area opens out on to the back garden. A kitchen and third reception room complete the accommodation. 'We have the benefit of open space, yet it is still cosy and warm due to a large woodburner in one of the reception rooms,' says Rowan. 'I'll definitely miss the place.' Rowan is moving to Witney so that his children can be closer to their schools and friends.","Sir Richard Branson converted The Old Chapel into a home in the 1970s .

d105487b1329280104fcbd7309d87d9b630ecefa,"About 4.45 billion years ago, 150 million years after the solar system formed, Earth was hit by a Mars-size object called Theia. The collision created the moon, but debate has raged exactly what happened during this event - and a mystery has persisted on why the moon and Earth are so similar in their composition. Now, conflicting studies have provided two different theories - one that Theia was similar to Earth, and another that Earth and the moon were showered by debris following the collision. Three studies have provided different theories for what happened after Earth was struck by a Mars-sized object called Theia, 4.45 billion years ago. What is agreed on, though, is that the impact actually happened (artist's illustration shown). This is known as the giant impact hypothesis . The two theories appear in the journal Nature across three studies - two in favour of the ‘similar to Earth’ theory, and the other favouring the ‘shower of debris’ model. In the latter theory, a team of scientists at the University of Maryland said the impact of Theia with Earth was so violent, the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon. Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. But one mystery has persisted, revealed by rocks the Apollo astronauts brought back from the moon - why are the moon and Earth so similar in their composition? Several different theories have emerged over the years to explain the similar fingerprints of Earth and the moon. Perhaps the impact created a huge cloud of debris that mixed thoroughly with the Earth and then later condensed to form the moon. Or Theia could have, coincidentally, been isotopically similar to young Earth. A third possibility is that the moon formed from Earthen materials, rather than from Theia, although this would have been a very unusual type of impact. This cloud would have been composed of some Earth material, explaining the similarity between Earth and the moon, and other material. ‘This means that, right after the moon formed, it had exactly the same isotopic composition as Earth's mantle,’ said Dr Richard Walker, a professor of geology at UMD and co-author of the study. Both bodies have a similar isotopic ‘fingerprint,’ notably similar types of Tungsten, suggesting they had a similar origin. One difference, though, is that Earth has proportionally much less of a lighter isotope known as Tungsten-182. The team said this is because after both bodies formed, Earth swept up more debris that had little Tungsten-182. ‘We still need to work out the details, but it's clear that our early solar system was a very violent place,’ added Dr Walker. The team said their theory largely rules out the idea that the Mars-sized body Theia was of similar composition, or that the moon formed from only material contained in the pre-impact Earth. The other studies, though, disagree. Scientists at the Israel Institute of Technology and the Southwest Research Institute in Colorado said that Theia actually had a similar composition to Earth. Dr Alessandra Mastrobuono-Battisti and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets and compared the composition of each surviving planet with the composition of its last giant impactor. In one theory, a team of scientists at the University of Maryland said that the impact of Theia with Earth was so violent, the resulting debris cloud mixed thoroughly before settling down and forming the moon. Shown is an artist's illustration of the young Earth and moon . The University of Maryland team examined the tungsten isotopic composition of two moon rocks collected by the Apollo 16 mission, including sample 68815, seen here. When corrected for meteoritic additions to Earth and the moon after formation of the moon, the two bodies had identical Tungsten isotopic compositions . Supporting evidence includes the Earth's spin and Moon's orbit having similar orientations. Moon samples indicating the surface of the moon was once molten also provide evidence,  as does the moon's relatively small iron core. The moon also has a lower density compared to Earth, while there is evidence of similar collisions in other star systems (that result in debris disks). Giant collisions are also consistent with the leading theories of the formation of the solar system. And finally, the stable isotope ratios of lunar and terrestrial rock are identical, implying a common origin. They found that 20 to 40 per cent of impactors had similar compositions to the planets they impacted, whereas planets that formed in the same simulation tended to have distinct compositions. The authors suggest their results may explain the similarities between Earth and the moon - and why their compositions differ from those of other planets in the solar system. ‘We find that different planets formed in the same simulation have distinct compositions, but the compositions of giant impactors are statistically more similar to the planets they impact,’ the researchers wrote. They said their theory has a 20 per cent probability of correct. Whichever theory turns out to be correct though, both are in agreement that the formation of the moon remains a confusing mystery that is yet to be fully solved. ‘This is interesting stuff and no one has all the answers regarding the formation of the moon - we certainly don't claim to,’ Dr Walker, one of the authors of the former study, told MailOnline. However, the other theory says that Earth (left) and the moon (right) are so similar because the initial Mars-sized object, Theia, actually had a similar composition to Earth. Dr Alessandra Mastrobuono-Battisti and colleagues simulated collisions between protoplanets to make their finding .","The moon formed when a Mars-sized body called Theia hit it early on .

d20a452567cf0f0c3ac57d2ba19eaaf69b1edc37,"A teenager had to close her mother’s shop to detain a shoplifter for three hours until police arrived – only for them to let her off with a caution. Katie Cope, 17, said she feared being assaulted by the agitated woman after police repeatedly refused to give her an estimated time for their arrival. She had to close the shop and put down the electronic shutter after the thief became abusive towards other customers and kept trying to leave. Let down: Store owner Eve Cope with assistant, Sol, who helped Katie to detain the shoplifter . When police finally got to the vintage clothing store, they said the stolen knickers, which had been reduced to £1, were not worth enough to prosecute. Yesterday, Katie and her mother Eve Cope, 60, told of their fury at the police’s response and accused officers of giving a ‘green light’ to shoplifters by merely cautioning the 66-year-old culprit. Mrs Cope, who has owned the Baklash store in Nottingham city centre for 33 years, was away when the thief struck last Thursday. She said: ‘I was really scared for the safety of my daughter. I do feel like the police let the shoplifter off. ‘This must be the fifth time I have had to deal with a shoplifter in the last few years – on one occasion I was even assaulted and hit my head on the pavement outside the shop when I tried to stop a thief. ‘The police asked me to drop the case against the girl responsible because she offered to apologise and pay for the shirt she stole.’ Katie said: ‘It is a ridiculous situation. I could have been in trouble if the woman had reacted aggressively to being held in the shop. ‘I’m really disappointed with the police. Letting this woman off just gives a green light to shoplifters.’ A male shop assistant called Sol was working with Katie when she spotted the shoplifter leaving with a pair of knickers in her handbag. Katie stopped the thief outside the shop at 2.50pm and led her back inside while Sol dialled 101 – the police non-emergency number. Katie said: ‘I was not going to let her go. She didn’t apologise and when police eventually got here she lied about her age and her name three times.’ Officers arrived within nine minutes after Mrs Cope, pictured outside her store, made a formal complaint . When Katie was still waiting for a police response three hours later, Mrs Cope rang to make a formal complaint and officers arrived nine minutes later, at 6.10pm. Mrs Cope said: ‘They told us that because the underwear was only priced at £1, they would not prosecute. ‘I told them it wasn’t just the value of the knickers at play here, but the fact we had lost three hours of trade by having to close. They just told me I would have to pursue a civil case for damages against the thief if I wanted to take it further.’ Local councillor Michael Edwards called the incident ‘concerning’. A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: ‘We aim to provide the best possible service to anyone who calls to report a crime, but in periods of high demand response times can be affected.’ Nottinghamshire Police and Crime Commissioner Paddy Tipping said: ‘I am sorry that the business in question had a problem. Shoplifting is not as much of a problem as it used to be.’ However, figures from crime data analysts, UK Crime Stats, showed that in Nottingham there was a rise in shoplifting offences from 288 last February to 324 this February.","Katie Cope, 17, detained a shoplifter in her mother's vintage clothing store .

Anything north of 4,000 is usually reserved for summer tentpoles and year-end titles. Overseas, the movie is also poised to do massive business, putting its global debut north of $250 million. ""Furious 7"" is opening day-and-date around the world on 10,500 screens in 63 territories, save for a few major markets including China, Russia and Japan. THR: 'Furious 7' scores Thailand release despite Tony Jaa contract dispute . The current record-holder for top April opening domestically is ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" which debuted to $95 million from 3,928 theaters last year. ""Furious 7"" is likewise poised to nab the biggest opening of 2015 to date. And if it beats the $121.9 million launch of ""The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1"" in November 2014, it will mark the largest three-day opening since ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" ($158 million) in November 2013. The movie enjoys massive awareness and interest, due to both the popularity of the street-racing series and Walker's death. The last film,"" Fast & Furious 6,"" debuted to a franchise-best $117 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 2012, including $97.4 million for the three days, on its way to grossing $788.7 million worldwide. Universal intended to open ""Furious 7"" on July 11, 2014, but production was halted in November 2013 when Walker died in a car crash during the Thanksgiving hiatus. After director James Wan, writer Chris Morgan and Universal pored over existing footage and tweaked the script, production resumed in April 2014. THR: Studio profitability report - Who's up and who's down . CGI and voice effects were used in some scenes featuring Walker's detective character, Brian O'Conner, with Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody, used as stand-ins. ""Furious 7"" pits Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto and crew (which includes Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson, among others, as well as Walker) against Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw, out for revenge after the death of his brother. ""Furious 7"" is expected to usher in a string of mega-openings at the box office this year. Disney and Marvel's ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" set to open May 1, hasn't come on tracking yet, but some forecasters are already suggesting it could score the top opening of all time domestically, eclipsing the record-breaking start of ""The Avengers"" ($207 million) in 2012.

9d191c0169162e121fb9523a0153e510076fad56,"Murdered: Road rage victim Shahnawaz was returning home from a family function when the shocking attack occurred . At around 10.30pm on Sunday, Turkman Gate lived up to Delhi’s reputation as a city that has lost its soul. Two children, 13 and nine years old, stood wailing and begging bystanders as five local strongmen mercilessly beat their father to death over a traffic quarrel. Road rage claimed another life. No one in the crowd came forward. The police did not arrive from a chowki merely 50 metres away. You could tick every item on Delhi’s infamous check-list. When no one came to their father’s rescue, the hapless children ran to the cops, who asked them to call 100. By the time the police reached the spot, their father was lying in a pool of blood, and was declared dead on arrival at the Lok Nayak Hospital. The death of 40-year-old Shahnawaz has shaken the city. Murders are commonplace in the Capital, but a man being thrashed to death because his motorcycle grazed a car as bystanders watched in silence is a new low even by Delhi’s standards. Also, while Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi boasts about the new police motto “Shanti, Seva or Naya” and compares the force to the best-rated police departments across the globe, his men stood and watched Shahnawaz die without raising a finger. According to the Delhi Police, Shahnawaz was returning home from a family function with his two sons on a motorbike when it grazed a car near Turkman Gate in Daryaganj. Iron rods . The driver of the i20 car, identified as Shadab, got into a verbal spat with Shahnawaz. Shadab reportedly told Shahnawaz to move his bike as he was unable to manoeuvre his car. When Shahnawaz expressed his inability to do so due to heavy traffic, Shadab, along with Khalid Amin, another occupant of the car, started thrashing Shahnawaz with iron rods. Later, three other occupants of the car,  Atif Lala, Mohammed Wasim, and another unidentified person, got out and joined them. Seeing their father being attacked so mercilessly, Fahad and his younger brother Kaif tried to hold back the accused, but were pushed aside. The boys then ran to the nearest barricade where two policemen were standing and begged them to help their father. ‘Dial 100’ The cops allegedly told them to dial 100. The children then ran to their grandmother's house nearby and said: “Abu ki bahar ladai ho gayi hai kuch logo ke saath (Dad is involved in a fight outside with some people)”. By the time the family reached the spot, it was already too late. Shahnawaz, bleeding heavily, was rushed to the nearby Lok Nayak Jaiprakash Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.

Heart-breaking: Shahnawaz's mother breaks down in the Walled City after hearing the news of her son's death . Numb with grief: Shahnawaz's devastated parents are supported by relatives . On Monday evening, almost 24 hours after the incident, Turkman Gate wore an uneasy calm. Throughout the day, Shahnawaz’s family members and relatives sat in protest on the road with his body. A crowd of 200 choked the entire stretch, causing traffic jams across central Delhi in places like New Delhi railway station, ITO, Mandi House and Connaught Place circle. Protesters held up a banner which had Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s picture along with those of the accused, demanding quick arrests. The victim’s relatives said police are trying to protect Amin. “Amin was the one who triggered the spat and started thrashing Shahnawaz. Police are clueless even after 12 hours of the incident,” Shahnawaz’s relative, Shahbuddin, told Mail Today. Delhi Police chief Bassi has assured that all accused will be arrested soon. “Mohammed Wasim has been arrested and the hunt for the remaining four is on,” he said, while briefing the media. Family of goons on a short fuse claims life . By Ankur Sharma in New Delhi . The arrogance and short temper of a family which has right connections with policemen and local politicians has snuffed out an innocent life. Residents of Delhi’s Turkman Gate, where 40-year-old Shahnawaz was thrashed to death on Sunday night, allege that main accused Khalid Amin alias Amin Pahalwan belongs to a family of goons, and all his 17 brothers are involved in illegal activities. In 2011, Amin was involved in a fight with former MLA Shoaib Iqbal. Three of the other accused in the Turkman Gate killing were also embroiled in that case. Relatives of the road rage victim point to the photos of some of the accused on an AAP hoarding in the area. However, a local AAP leader said they were not members of the party . Amin was initially a petty criminal. He was first arrested along with an associate in 1995 in an attempt to murder case from Seelampur area of North-East Delhi. The rogue element of Chandni Mahal area started a construction business since 2010. “He has a construction and a handicraft business, but he is involved in various criminal cases. His brothers are also facing criminal charges,” a senior police officer said. Amin is allegedly involved in eight criminal cases - robbery, an attempt to murder, rioting and incidents of causing hurt. “He always carries a country-made pistol and a knife,” police sources said. Importantly, Amin enjoys good connections with the local police as his day-to-day work requires their co-operation. Drunk men thrash LS MP's son in another case . The Turkman Gate incident was not the only case of road rage reported in the Capital on Sunday. In another case, the son of a Lok Sabha MP was allegedly thrashed by three men in South Delhi’s South Extension area. The Delhi Police have arrested three accused in connection with the incident after registering a case under five IPC sections. According to police sources, the incident occurred when Ritu Raj, the son of Jahanabad MP Dr Arun Kumar, asked one of the accused to not park his Scooty in front of the gate of his residence. “Around 10pm, the police got a call from South Extension Part-2 that three-four men have beaten up a man. When the police reached the spot, they found the MP’s son lying on the road. A PCR vehicle took the victim to the nearest hospital. “After examining him, the doctors said Ritu Raj had dislocated his shoulder,” a police officer said. Sources said the police have arrested three accused. The main accused has been identified as Manohar Lal Batra. Ritu Raj also told the police that all the accused were drunk when they thrashed him. The accused also allegedly threatened to kill the victim’s sister if she intervened.","Shahnawaz, 40, was beaten to death by five thugs because his bike - stuck in traffic - was blocking their way .

The PM was speaking in a rather peculiar building – an almost empty science park on the city’s outskirts, its round atrium area filled with party activists. The space was uncomfortably hot and Mr Cameron was looking straight into a merciless, piercing, armpit-moistening sun. The prime ministerial upper lip was soon glistening. Attack of the sweats! David Cameron worked up a sweat as he made a visit to Poole in Dorset and sunny Bristol. Pictured: The Prime Minister speaks with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota over lunch in a sun-drenched garden . It was such a glorious bank holiday, why on earth did Tory high command not scrap their plans, strip down to shirts and chinos and campaign on the beach at Weston-super-Mare? They might at least have found some swing voters there. But there is something clinical, immutable, rigid, unspontaneous so far about this Tory campaign. Well, all the parties’ campaigns, really. Strategists with precious plans have plotted every minute of every low-risk day and the politicians look more remote from the electors than ever. Mr Cameron was appearing alongside George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer, both of them in weekday suits. On some news-management grid many moons ago it had been decided that tax was to be the theme of the day. I suppose no one guessed it might be high-summerish weather. Bank holidays are usually washouts. And so tax remained the dish du jour. The day was hailed as ‘Money Back Monday’ because it was the start of the financial year and the new, more generous tax allowances for the low-paid meant an extra £600 in people’s pockets. Mr Cameron had spent the morning in Poole, Dorset (where veteran Lib Dem MP Annette Brooke is retiring) and apparently ate a hot dog while he was there. One of the reporters who had been on his campaign bus said he had met ‘at least two voters’. He arrived at the Bristol and Bath Science Park at 4.40pm. As his battle bus approached the destination, one of his police bodyguards made plain his feelings by being spectacularly sick, poor soul. Perhaps the copper had been food taster for the hot dog. Everyone getting off the bus looked a bit green. The audience had been waiting for some time, broiling slowly in the building’s atrium. What a soulless place it was, of antiseptic design with bleached wood and long, lifeless corridors. Vast windows. An airport-style exterior. We could have been anywhere in the world – the middle of Texas, the plains of central France, or at a yet-to-open business hotel in Bulgaria. Prime Minister David Cameron and George Osborne make a speech at the Bristol and Bath Science Park . During his Bristol visit, Mr Cameron read a speech and said there was a ‘moral’ case for the Tories’ policies . Bristol has a handful of seats, local Tory MPs being Chris Skidmore, Charlotte Leslie and Jack Lopresti. Might it not have made more sense to hold a rally underneath Clifton suspension bridge – somewhere that at least had a resonance with the city? A tanned Mr Cameron dutifully made his prepared speech, saying that there was a ‘moral’ case for the Tories’ economic policies. Fetch that, Mr Archbishop of Canterbury. It was ‘frankly immoral to spend money like it grows on trees’. He said he and the Tories would spend money on ‘your family, your future’ rather than on ‘bureaucracy or bloat or the latest crackpot Government scheme’. This innovative use of ‘bloat’ as a noun was repeated three times. Don’t vote bloat. Maybe it should be their new slogan. After ten minutes he let George Osborne make a speech. Eeek. George stepped into the glare and you have seldom seen a man look so deathly pale. Shades of the sepulchre on Easter morning. A brief session of questions saw Mr Cameron being asked about recent Lib Dem eruptions – Nick Clegg calling Mr Osborne ‘a very dangerous man’ and Danny Alexander alleging that the Tories are not interested in helping the poor. Mr Cameron said it was inevitable that ‘you’ll find the minor parties saying increasingly desperate things’. He was unfazed by ‘the odd noise-off from a deputy’. Or should that be noise-off from an odd deputy?","David Cameron enjoyed visit to Bristol with Chancellor George Osborne .

3358680dbd18b8a94734ef06b6450d77cb91a2f3,"(CNN)Jon Reiter is no stranger to Mount Everest -- its world-record height, its prestige, its challenges. And its dangers. He learned that again shortly before noon Saturday, after a monster magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. It not only rattled cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara, but caused avalanches at Everest and nearby peaks. Reiter was safe but shaken by the devastation. He told his wife, Susan, about his putting one dead person in a sleeping bag and zipping it up, seeing others killed by the falling ice and collapsing snow, and doing all he could to help others fighting for their lives. ""It's been a really rough day,"" Susan Reiter told CNN. ""Jon's been comforting injured people that he doesn't think will survive."" Jon Reiter told CNN on Sunday morning that 17 people had been killed on the mountain. The Indian Army's Everest Expedition evacuated the bodies of 13 mountaineers from a base camp who had been preparing to scale the mountain,  spokesman Col. Rohan Anand said Saturday. Separately, Dr. Nima Namgyal told CNN he has seen 14 bodies so far. Many of those killed came from other countries, according to Namagyal, something that's not surprising given Everest's lure for many hikers around the world. What may be as remarkable is all those who survived, a number that's likely in the hundreds. They are women and men like Alex Gavan, who tweeted about running for his life from his tent. ""Huge disaster,"" the mountaineer said hours later, warning that the death toll could skyrocket if helicopters didn't come quickly to evacuate those hurt. ""Helped searched and rescued victims through huge debris area. Many dead. Much more badly injured. More to die if not heli asap."" Another hiker, Carsten Lillelund Pedersen, wrote on Facebook that ""a huge avalanche swept over basecamp"" that had almost 500 tents, saying he survived by hiding behind a stone structure. Afterward, the camp's dining tent was transformed into a makeshift hospital headed by the camp manager, who happens to be a doctor. And even hours after the biggest quake struck, the threat of more casualties -- and the challenge of finding out how high the toll actually is -- remained very real. ""On top of the whiteout after the avalanche it has been snowing since last night so it is difficult to see the following avalanches, and there are so many - maybe one every 5 min - that I have stopped counting,"" Pedersen wrote on Facebook. ""This also makes it more difficult to search for people."" Several companies specialize in bringing hikers to Everest. One of the biggest is Alpine Ascents International, based in Washington state. ""The Alpine Ascents International Mt. Everest climbing team was in the icefall and is now safe at Camp 1, avoiding the avalanche that hit Base Camp,"" the Seattle-based company reported on Facebook. ""Please keep those affected in your thoughts as we continue to receive updated reports on the damage and losses in Nepal."" But not every foreign company that brings climbers to Nepal was so lucky. Two reported the deaths of Americans on the mountain. That includes British-based Jagged Globe, which has offered mountaineering expeditions, courses, adventure skiing and other experiences for the past 20 years. The company reported Saturday that American Dan Fredinburg died in the Everest base camp avalanche, while two others suffered non-life-threatening injuries. A Google executive who made headlines for dating actress Sophia Bush, Fredinburg had been posting photos and updates of his adventures in Nepal on Instragram and Twitter, where he referred to himself as an ""adventurer, inventor, and energetic engineer."" His sister updated the account with a message, saying he suffered a major head injury. ""We appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us. All our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man. He was and is everything to us,"" his sister, Megan, wrote. The expedition company sent its condolences. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dan's family and friends,"" read a statement on Jagged Globe's website, ""whilst we pray too for all those who have lost their lives in one of the greatest tragedies ever to hit this Himalayan nation."" Eve Girawong, a base camp medic from New Jersey who worked on the mountain, also was killed, according to her family and employer. ""On behalf of my family, it is with deep sadness that I write that our beloved daughter, younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today.  Nong Eve Girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others.  Words cannot describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering,"" a family member wrote on Facebook. She was working for Madison Mountaineering, a boutique mountain guide service based in Seattle. Kurt Hunter, one of the company's co-founders, confirmed her death. Jim Whittaker, the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest back in 1963, is still a mentor to experienced climbers trying to follow in his footsteps. The 86-year-old confirmed that climbers he knows to currently be on Everest are safe. But some are trapped above the icefall, ""which is very dangerous anyway,"" Whittaker told CNN. Since the avalanches, ""the whole route would be different now than before the quake. They'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall ... They (the climbers) will have to cool it for a couple days, way until the route is reestablished ... they've got enough food and fuel for the stoves."" His son, Leif Whittaker, told CNN that he hasn't heard from everyone he knows to be on Everest. ""It's really tragic and I'm really saddened by the news,"" he said. ""I have a lot friends in the area and friends on Everest right now. It's hard to get news from base camp and the mountains because communication is difficult as it is. Many of my friends are safe, but I'm not sure if all of them are. ""It's been a bad few years on Everest,"" he said. ""My heart goes out to them, and I'm sending them my love and strength."" This tragedy struck just over a year after another deadly avalanche on the 29,035-foot peak that likewise sent everyone -- from seasoned Sherpas to foreign tourists -- running for their lives. At least 13 Nepalese locals and Sherpas were killed in that incident, which at the time was the deadliest incident ever around Everest. The highest single-day death toll before then came in May 1996, when eight climbers disappeared during a big storm -- an episode chronicled in Jon Krakauer's bestselling book, ""Into Thin Air."" Given the scale of the avalanches and fact they occurred near the start of the busy spring climbing season, it's possible this day could turn out to be the most deadly. Climbers traditionally arrive in April to get acclimated to the high altitude before trying to scale the summit. There's no guarantee they'll get the chance to go up this season. After last year's avalanches, the mountain was shut down. But whether it's their livelihood or their obsession, the people who tackle Everest will be back. ""This is our job,"" said Pasang Sherpa, who lost ""friends in brothers"" in the 2014 avalanche. ""So there is always a risk of death."" For many mountaineers, the draw of Everest has long been hard to resist. One of them is Reiter, who has scaled all of ""The Seven Summits"" -- the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- except this one. This would be his third straight year trying. He turned back in 2013 ""because it didn't feel right"" and survived last year's avalanche, according to his wife Susan. Her husband phoned her multiple times since the latest avalanches, reassuring her that he's OK physically even as he struggles emotionally with the tragedy. But does that mean he won't go back to try to scale Everest again? ""You would think that he wouldn't because of this and because of last year,"" Susan Reiter said from her Northern California home. ""But knowing my husband I think he will. I hope not, but I don't want to hold him back."" Nepal rescue efforts come down to neighbors . CNN's Katia Hetter, Jessica King and Carma Hassan contributed to this report.","Family of American medic killed posts message on Facebook says she died while at base camp .

Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks, known as Extra Vehicular Activities, on GoPro cameras outside the ISS on February 25 and March 1. The spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of multibillion pound commercial spacecraft, which Nasa hope will be in operation by 2017. Expedition 42 commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts recorded three spacewalks on GroPro cameras . Nasa recently signed a contract with commercial spaceflight companies SpaceX and Boeing with the intention to produce craft capable of transporting astronauts to the ISS. The clip was recorded to give the future ISS workers an idea of what they can expect when they go into space to maintain the commercial spacecraft. In the footage Virts and Wilmore can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system for the future docking spacecraft. The spacewalks were in preparation for the arrival of 2017's multibillion pound commercial spacecraft . The astronauts can be seen repairing the robotic arm of the space station and installing a new communication system . Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998. It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three. The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km). It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house. It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour. The two men also set up antennas and routed 4000 feet (1219m) of power and data cables. The video captures breathtakingly clear images of earth as astronauts work from a distance of 250 miles. Nasa has recently relied on Russian Soyuz capsules taking astronauts to ISS to carry out maintenance work since its space shuttle fleet was retired in 2011 after 30 years’ service. But at a cost of nearly £50 million per seat, it has not been a financially viable solution. Nasa now hope that their deals with SpaceX and Boeing can cut the cost of their future transportation fees. The International Space Station is a habitable artificial satellite in low earth orbit. It is now the largest artificial body in orbit, since its first component was launched in 1998, and is often visible to the naked eye from earth.

50f6d07da42088a596d60de4ff412c48c8e199c5,"It is the biggest culinary question which divides the Westcountry: when eating a scone, do you add jam or cream first? Today David Cameron waded into the long-running dispute, and quickly got into a muddle about the Devon and Cornish way of eating a cream tea. The Prime Minister made the gaffe on a campaign visit to Devon, before risking the wrath of purists by claiming 'it all tastes the same'. Scroll down for video . David Cameron, on a visit to Devon this morning, made the blunder of confusing the two methods for eating a cream tea . How do you eat your scone? How do you eat your scone? Now share your opinion . The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority. But his hopes of courting support in the county were given a knock with his food faux pas as he chatted with staff and customers of Tea by the Taw on The Strand in Barnstaple, the North Devon Gazette reported. All good politicians know how to make small talk with voters, but the jam and cream debate is no trifling matter. In an attempt to woo the locals, Mr Cameron ventured: 'When you are in Devon you do the jam and the cream in a different order to Cornwall, is that right?' Sensing a gaffe was imminent, he went on: 'I'm going to get this wrong, aren't I?' His prediction was correct, as he added: 'In Devon it's... jam first and cream on top?' His comments were greeted with silence and stony faces, as the staff realised someone was going to have to put the Prime Minister right. 'Wrong way round. I knew I'd get it wrong,' Mr Cameron said. 'It all tastes the same, doesn't it?'. Wrangles over whether it should be jam first or cream, and whipped cream or clotted, have been running for generations, with references to the sweet treat dating back to the 11th century. The Devon tradition is to slather the scone with cream first, while the Cornish – who also lay claim to inventing cream teas – prepare their scones the opposite way. Two years ago, an academic devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea, and it used the Cornish way. Dr Eugenia Cheng, of Sheffield University, concluded that the best weight ratio is 2:1:1, which means an average scone, weighing 70g, requires 35g of jam and 35g of cream . The Tory leader has spent the day campaigning in Devon, where he must win several seats if he is to stand any chance of winning a majority . Academic Dr Eugenia Cheng, of Sheffield University, devised what was claimed to be the mathematical formula for the perfect cream tea, and it used the Cornish way. Dr Cheng set the ideal thickness of the scone, with all its elements added, at about 2.8cm, allowing a relaxed open width of the mouth when taking a bite. The equation also specifies the thickness of the cream and jam layers. Dr Cheng's formula is a victory for Cornwall, with jam spread first due to avoid it running off the edge. Another rule in the scientific method is to use clotted rather than whipped cream. This is due to the excessive volume of whipped cream needed to satisfy the weight ratio. The thickness of the layer should not exceed that of the scone.","Prime Minister makes culinary blunder as he tries to woo Devon voters .

Law enforcement were called  to The Beverly Hills Hotel at approximately 1:30am where the 50-year-old reality star was hanging out at the Polo Lounge. Radar reports that at some point after midnight the mother-of-four was refused service by a bartender after she'd had a few too many vodka tonics. The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills star then became very angry and reportedly shouted 'Don't you know who I am?' Scroll down for video . In jail: Kim Richards was arrested on Thursday morning after becoming belligerent while intoxicated at the Polo Lounge in The Beverly Hills Hotel . Kim - who has struggled with substance abuse in the past - then headed to a bathroom and refused to come out  - which was when cops were called. A source told the website: 'She eventually locked herself in a bathroom and was refusing to come out and causing a scene. Cops had to be called at that point.' According to Beverly Hills Police Department spokesman Lt. Lincoln Hoshino, Kim appeared 'belligerent with slurred speech and wreaking of a strong odor of alcohol.' Kim allegedly cursed at officers and 'passively resisted arrest,' Hoshino said. Where is went down: After drinking vodka tonics all night a bartender at The Polo Lounge refused to serve the former child star and she then became angry saying 'Don't you know who I am?' Taking a turn for the worse: After resisting arrest Kim - who apparently smelled strongly of booze - was eventually booked into a local jail where she kicked a police officer . TMZ reports the reality star had to be dragged out of the restrooms and taken to a nearby jail where she kicked a police officer. The reality star was issued a citation for trespass, resisting arrest, battery on a police officer and drunk in public and was later released on $20,000 bail at around 10:30am in the morning. She is due to appear at the Los Angeles Superior Court on May 10. Sources close to Kim's family tell People that they are heartbroken at the star's behaviour which has become more erratic in recent months. 'It will never get better. … She's been a mess, showing up late to events and social gatherings and acting bizarre or belligerent or both.' 'They of course love [Kim] and want to help, but no one can talk any sense into her because she is so out of it.' Really friends? Kim's supposed BFF Brandi Glanville took to her Twitter shortly after hearing the arrest news . Cast support: Kim's RHOBH cast mate Lisa Rinna tweeted her support despite questioning Kim's sobriety throughout the latest season . Empathy: Eileen Davidson also shared her reaction on Twitter shortly after news of Kim's arrest . The news may be unsurprising for some of her loved ones, however, as Us Weekly reported that she has been treating friends and family members terribly as a source said: 'Kim has been on the outs from her family recently. 'Things are so bad that nobody can deal with her. You can’t even talk to her for two seconds -- she turns horrible to everybody.' This type of reported behaviour is so alarming that some experts believe it would be best for Bravo to dismiss the television personality from the reality programme according to People. 'This is one of those moments when her painfully public problem can become a personally promising opportunity to turn her life around,' said William C. Moyers from the Hazelden Betty For Foundation, 'But only if she takes seriously the reality of what's happened, by stepping away from the limelight and instead putting her attention on the help she needs and deserves to get better.' 'There is nothing funny or appealing about the reality of Kim's situation,' the expert added. 'She owes it to herself to step away from the limelight to get help. Her costars and Bravo should encourage Kim to take the first step or next step to recover.' Her on-screen group: Kim's sobriety was a major plot point during the fifth season of the hit reality series (pictured at the reunion in February) All talk? In Tuesday night's finale reunion show Kim was adamant that she is not struggling with her sobriety . During an episode of RHOBH in January, Kim maintained 'I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do drugs … I don't have anything to hide,' after being asked outright if she was still sober. On Tuesday's finale reunion episode of RHOBH, the former actress was defiant that everyone stop discussing her sobriety - insisting that when she popped a pill at Eileen's poker party it was a one-off under extraordinary circumstances. 'I took a pill for a chronic pain that I was having. Did I take somebody else's pill? Yes. Was that right? No.' Kim explained of taking a pill from ex-husband Monty, who has been battling cancer. Kim continued: 'Let's get this straight real quick - I am not struggling with my sobriety, nor have I struggled with my sobriety,' she said. After questioning where anyone had any real concern for her, she again insisted: 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years. I don't appreciate all the conversations that have been behind my back. And I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Defiant: Kim told her co-stars 'I am sober. I have been sober for three years and I do not have to defend myself any longer.' Family tension: The reality star also came to blows with her sister Kyle (pictured in red) during the hour-long show with Bravo's Andy Cohen . Co-star Lisa Rinna shot back 'Well Kim I'm just going to say - you showed up at my house and you were higher than a kite,' which further infuriated Kim who stressed that she had been open about that one occasion.' Kim's RHOBH cast mates expressed their reaction to their friend's arrest on their Twitter pages. 'I was sad to hear about Kim’s incident and I wish her and her family the best,' Rinna tweeted. 'I feel badly for Kim Richards and her family my thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time,' said Eileen Davidson. And BFF Brandi Glanville wrote: 'Wanted to say thank you to @KimRichards11 for donating to our school auction in the middle of all she has going on! so proud of her. 'Real friends are their in the good times,the bad times &especially the worst times.I am blessed with real friends & am a real friend myself.' Another one under her belt: Season five came to an end with part three of the reunion show which aired on Tuesday . Kim voluntarily entered rehab for alcohol addiction in December 2011  for the third time for and has been trying to stay sober ever since. In January 2012, Kim told Bravo's Andy Cohen in her first TV interview since her rehab stay: 'I'm an alcoholic. I had so much guilt and shame for my behavior... then I drank to cover the guilt and shame to make it go away.' In a separate sit down interview, Kim said, 'I'm getting reconnected with my kids, and that's been a huge thing for me. It's not what I expected when I came home. I was like, ""Hey! I'm home! Let's all get back exactly where we were!"" And they were like, ""Ummm, life is a little different now."" So it was like a little bit of a challenge when I got home, which I didn't expect.' She has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson, plus one son, Chad Davis. Her brood: Kim has four adult children, daughters Brooke Brinson, Whitney Davis and Kimberly Jackson and son Chad Davis . Famous: Here, Kim was in Different Strokes . Kim has now become most notable for her work on Bravo's Real Housewives franchise but her acting career began when she was six-years-old. The former child actor starred in numerous seventies TV programs including Nanny And The Professor and Little House On The Prairie. She also has a long resume of Disney films such as Escape to Witch Mountain, No Deposit, No Return and Return from Witch Mountain.

Hotel industry insider turned author Jacob Tomsky shares his tales from working in two top hotels in New Orleans and New York City and provides lots of little-known tips to ensure guests make the most of every hotel stay. MailOnline Travel chatted with Tomsky to get the answers to some of our most burning hotel questions... Scroll down for video . Hotel industry insider turned author, Jacob Tomsky, reveals the most common items people take from hotels . What are some of the most common items that people take from hotels? Without a doubt, toiletries and towels are definitely the most popular items for guests to pocket, according to Jacob Tomsky, author of Heads in Beds: A Reckless Memoir of Hotels, Hustles, and So-Called Hospitality. But some individuals staying at the hotel take things a bit too far. 'They take everything,' he tells MailOnline Travel. 'Duvet covers, little silver trashcans, universal remotes - anything that's not nailed down.' Despite common misconceptions, it is possible to pocket a plush robe - without incurring any charges . What can you usually get away with taking? Despite common misconceptions, you actually can get away with stealing that coveted hotel room robe. 'If you were to, say, check into a room, take a fresh robe and pack it away in your suitcase, then call down and say your room didn't have a robe in it when you checked in, is the hotel staff going to search your belongings? Highly unlikely,' Tomsky reveals. And when it comes to pocketing toiletries, you can occasionally even ask for more. 'There are other items, as well - complimentary amenities that you may not be aware are available,' he explains. 'Good hotels keep extra items, such as slippers, razors and shaving cream, travel lint rollers, and mini-deodorants, in stock but not displayed in the room.' As it turns out, the minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel, full of items 'sold at an absurd mark-up' If you lie about using the minibar, will the hotel really charge you? 'The minibar is the most fallible system in the hotel,' Tomsky tells MailOnline Travel. 'Human error, over-stocking, failure to re-stock, errant charges from weighted items being shifted but not consumed, all of these lead the front desk to spend hours a day slicing off incorrect charges.' He also notes that the 'items are purchased in bulk and sold at an absurd mark-up.' 'Hotels are much more concerned with your overall experience and securing further room nights - the main revenue stream - than whether or not you ate a candy bar.' Mike Holovacs, a front office supervisor at a major hotel chain and an adjunct hospitality instructor, adds: 'If an item has not sold, it's just like any other retail setting - the item is pulled when it reaches its expiration date.' Because certain rooms have varying levels of cleaning difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' How long does it take to clean a hotel room? Is there anything that typically does not get cleaned? The length of cleaning time generally depends on the room. Because rooms have varying levels of difficulty, they are usually awarded 'points' and housekeepers must clean a certain total of points in one day. This may translate to a few larger suites or simply multiple standard rooms. 'I'd guess the average time is between 30 minutes to an hour to flip the room,' Tomsky estimates. 'A great deal of that time discrepancy depends on how the guest has left the room.' Once a year, large sections of rooms, or even entire floors are pulled out of service for maintenance and deep cleaning. 'This is includes sending the draperies out for cleaning and shampooing the carpets,' Holovacs explains. However, minibar glasses are often cleaned less thoroughly, usually soaked in shampoo or furniture polish . When it comes to the items that are cleaned less frequently or less thoroughly? Minibar glasses and the remote control. 'Housekeepers are usually responsible for cleaning the glasses, yet are not provided with dish soap,' he explains. 'So they either soak them in the sink with shampoo or, in a pinch, use furniture polish, as it leaves a 'clean-looking' shine.' And have you ever tried to clean your own remote? 'The rubbery buttons make it near impossible and dousing it with a cleaning agent could damage the circuitry,' Tomsky adds. How much money hotels spend on toiletries generally depends on the scale of the property and its occupancy . How much do hotels generally spend on toiletries per year? This one has everything to do with the scale of the property and its occupancy. According to a recent Forbes article, the Marriott hotel chain will spend approximately $20 million annually on their Thann products, a natural skincare line that's stocked in their Americas and Asia Pacific hotels. 'Usually the ordering is done by a housekeeping manager who takes into account the current supply and the average monthly uses from years past,' Tomsky reveals. 'People use more toiletries in the winter, have longer showers, and go through more toilet paper. 'It's a rather intriguing ordering process based on a large amount of collected data. 'And, ultimately, you don't want to be the one who fails to order enough toilet paper for the entire hotel.' Though there's a belief that hotel staffer furnish their home with amenities, Tomsky says it's not often the case . And do staff ever get to take them home? 'There's a long history of hotel staffers semi-furnishing their own home with hotel amenities,' Tomsky admits. 'Every party I threw from 2001 to 2004 was catered with hotel pillow chocolates. 'For the most part, items are either so pre-used that to take them would be distasteful, or so expensive that to steal them wouldn't be worth the loss of one's job. 'But I do have shoe polish that I've never paid for and hotel-branded slippers to keep me comfy in the wintertime.' One charity has come up with a novel way to deal with leftover hotel soaps - churning them together to provide soap to those in developing countries. Clean The World, receives partially-used and discarded soap from hotels, recycles it into millions of new bars, and then works with partner Global Soap to strategically distribute the new soap to people who lack access to it around the world. People dying in their hotel room is not quite as rare of an occurrence as guests may think, Tomsky admits . What happens if someone dies in a hotel room? While a bit morbid to talk about, Tomsky admits that such an occurrence is not quite as rare as guests may think. 'It's not something a hotel wishes to publicise, naturally,' he explains. 'So, they are removed as discreetly as possible. 'This may involve flashing lights and paramedics, depending on the severity of the situation, but can also happen via employee elevators and back exits.' Afterwards, the room is sanitised, cleaned, 'flipped' and sold - and that can happen a lot faster than you'd think. And, of course, all hotel staffers are forbidden from revealing any details - including cause of death and room numbers - to anyone. 'Death is a part of hotel life,' Tomsky adds. 'In fact, suicides often prefer hotels, relieving loved ones of the cleaning duties or seeing the deceased in a disturbing way.' Guests should take comfort in knowing that their in-room safes are actually very secure . Do staff actually have access to the in-room safes? No, they do not. The safes truly are, you know, safe. 'I always recommend using the safe to every traveller,' Tomsky says. 'The only person who can open the safe, should you forget your password, is a manager from the security department, using a tool that only they are trained and authorised to use.' What really happens to that half-used roll of loo paper in hotel room bathrooms? Well, it depends... And finally, what happens to the half-used loo roll in hotel room bathrooms? There's a bit of dispute over this one, and again, a lot of times it depends on the hotel itself. In the spirit of being environmentally-minded, most chains will simply refold the paper and leave the half-used roll in the bathroom, with another full roll behind it, should the guest run out. If there's not enough left to warrant leaving it, a Quora thread user, who works for the Beechmont Hotels Corporation, believes that the nearly-used up roll most likely winds up on housekeeping carts for when a room attendant needs a tissue for other cleaning tasks or in employee bathrooms.","Yes, it is possible to steal a robe from your hotel without being charged .

45270c9658132557043c1bb3747c762cef044343,"Former Rangers striker Marco Negri has revealed he quit the Scottish giants after fearing he was HIV-positive. Negri joined the Ibrox outfit from Italian side Perugia for £3.5million in 1997, scoring a staggering 23 goals in his first 10 league games for the club. However, a series of injuries destabilised his career in Glasgow including a reserve match against Aberdeen on November 13, 2000. Ex-Rangers forward Marco Negri has revealed that he quit the club after fearing he had AIDS . Cosenza (Italy) - 19 goals in 34 league games - (1994-95) Perugia (Italy) - 33 in 60 - (1995-97) Rangers - 32 in 30 - (1997-2001) Vicenza (Italy, on loan) - 1 in 9 - (1999-00) Bologna (Italy) - 0 in 3 - (2001-02) Cagliari (Italy) - 2 in 5 - (2002) Livorno (Italy) 8 in 10 - (2002-03) Perugia - 0 in 3 - (2004-05) During the encounter the then 30-year-old forward was on the receiving end of a crunching tackle that caused his right shinbone to bleed profusely. After hospital tests and treatment for what was perceived as a 'deep wound', Negri returned to action in the New Year to train with the reserve team where he suffered a shooting pain in his right knee and leg. Further scans at Ross Hall Hospital showed an inflammation of the shinbone and more worryingly that properties of his blood had been attacked by a lymphogranuloma or lymphosarcoma - common symptoms for those that suffer with HIV/AIDS. However, in his imminent autobiography 'Moody Blue - The Story of the Mysterious Marco', which is serialised in the Daily Record; the now 44-year-old reveals that his worst fears weren't confirmed after flying to Italy for treatment. 'I was immediately hospitalised. I hadn’t even considered the possibility of being HIV positive but the harsh reality was there in front of me in the medical report, and it was hard to ignore and digest,' Negri wrote. In his  autobiography, Negri (left) reveals his nightmare started after a reserve match vs Aberdeen in 2000 . After months of hospital scans in Scotland, Negri (right) was told in Italy that his blood was absolutely fine . 'I didn’t feel able to deal with such a thing alone. I needed my family around me and wanted to undergo further tests in Italy to understand exactly what was going on, the risks and chances of recovery. 'I had to return to Italy, and not on a temporary basis. I asked my lawyer to speak to Rangers about an early dissolution of my contract. 'They had no objections to the premature ending of our relationship, which was something I really appreciated, although it also showed me how serious my condition was. 'Luckily, I didn’t have to wait long to learn I was simply suffering a stress fracture of the tibial axis of the knee. This diagnosis was given by doctors in Bologna. In Scotland they hadn’t got it right this time, even if the results of three blood tests confirmed some anomalies that couldn’t be overlooked. 'Further tests found my blood to be absolutely fine and there was no need for medication or invasive treatment. My drama had been resolved in the best way possible, and I put behind me the endless days of terror when the worst case scenario was swimming around in my head.'

fe5ebcda00cc6bc8b52fb461e1958f3f2f1a170c,"Incredible footage has emerged of a mysterious pair of white lights seen hovering perilously close to to the Chilean volcano eruption. Volcano Calbuco, which has laid dormant for more than 40 years, suddenly erupted on Wednesday causing a thick plume of ash to cloud the sky while thousands of people living in its shadow were forced to flee the 'apocalypse-like' event. Hundreds filmed the eruption, near the southern port city of Puerto Montt, Chile, and its deadly ash cloud which caused all nearby flights to be grounded for safety. But one amateur cameraman was surprised to see what appeared to be white lights close to the enormous plume of ash and smoke rising from the mouth of the volcano. Scroll down for video . Mysterious white lights have been spotted hovering near Chile's erupting Calbuco volcano on Wednesday . A pair of strange glowing white lights were filmed floating perilously close to the smoke and gas clouds from the eruption . The pictures have since gone viral with internet user suggesting the lights were either police helicopters, an optical illusion or an alien aircraft . The footage shows the unexplained pair of lights floating dangerous close to erupting volcano before disappearing. Tens of thousands of people have speculated on what the UFO could be, suggesting everything from police or emergence services helicopters, to a kind of optical illusion or even an alien craft. One YouTube user, Perkoff, believed it was time travelers. He wrote: 'Most UFOs are not aliens like a lot of people think. They are in fact time machines from the future. The reason you see so many UFOs at historic events is because people from the future want to come back in time and witness history. A lot of these UFOs are filled with students and are just going on a futuristic version of a field trip.' Bud Ekins wrote: 'It wants to be filmed! Drones and planes don't disappear like that.' Others argues it was something a little more mundane. One YouTube user wrote: 'For me, chances are it's a drone.' While Francisco Javier Segurasaid: 'It's a airplane, come on! Up in smoke: Volcano Calbuco, in southern Chile, has erupted forcing 1,500 residents from Ensenada, about 10 miles away,  to flee their homes (pictured, a view of the eruption from Puerto Montt, a small city around 20 miles from the volcano) Smoke and lava can be seen spewing from the Calbuco volcano in this picture taken from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas . An electrical storm lights up the night sky as a huge column of ash and lava shoots out of the volcano. The eruption sparked a red alert in the port city of Puerto Montt . Volcano Calbuco, believed to be among the three most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes, had erupted for the first time at 6pm local time on Wednesday. An estimated 1,500 people were forced to flee the nearby town of Ensenada after the eruption, while several smaller townships were also cleared. Experts said the main risk was now now of a pyroclastic flow - a superheated current of gas and rock that can destroy nearly everything in its path and travel at speeds upwards of 200 to 300 kilometers per hour. Gabriel Orozco, a vulcanologist with Chile’s geological and mining service, said: “In this situation, with the eruption column so high, the main risk is that it collapses, falls due to gravity because of its own weight and causes a pyroclastic flow,” . Locals described an apocalyptic scene as ash clouds were shot six miles into the air creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region yesterday heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is located near the tourist town of Puerto Varas and the city of Puerto Montt, a little more than 620 miles south of Chile's capital, Santiago. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert, setting up an exclusion zone of 12.5miles around the volcano, barring access to the area. Trevor Moffat, who lives in Ensenada, some six miles from the volcano, said the eruption happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Dusted: A car covered in ash at the Ensenada locality, on the outskirts of Calbuco volcano .

Boats dusted with volcanic ash deposited from the eruptions of the looming Calbuco volcano, background, sit parked in front of a home . Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Unexpected: The volcano last erupted in 1972, and while it is widely believed to be among Chile's most dangerous, it was not under observation before it erupted today (the eruption pictured from Puerto Varas) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas go about their business while in the background the ash cloud from Volcano Calbuco is seen .

ed7283f0fb3e69cb4daa174aa082a31b02d6075e,"The New Zealand family of fourteen who last month walked out of a remote Christian commune that shuns the outside world are adjusting well to life in the wider community, a relative said, with the father accepting a farm job and the family moving into a home with modern appliances. James and Hope Ben Canaan last month declared they were living in a 'false system' and left the Gloriavale Christian Community, located at Lake Haupiri on New Zealand's West Coast, with their twelve children and few worldly possessions. Founded by the Australian-born evangelical preacher Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - Gloriavale is home to around 500 residents, sometimes known as Cooperites, who wear a plain, blue uniform and reject birth control. Scroll down for video . Free: The Ben Canaan family (picture supplied) have left behind Gloriavale for the outside world. Many family are pictured here in traditional Gloriavale uniforms, although they are now allowed to wear 'modest' clothing . Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament and reject the outside world . The Ben Canaans fled some 300km south to the town of Timaru, where supporters from the Marchwiel Reformed Baptist Church community have helped them adapt to a world where Christmas and birthdays are celebrated and money is used to purchase goods and services. '(They're doing) really, really good,' said Mr Ben Canaan's aunt, Miracle, who herself fled the picturesque commune with her husband and ten children around six years ago. 'They are adapting very well. They've got a job and everything. They've had a lot of support.' The family left Gloriavale, which is located at Lake Haupiri on the west coast of the South Island, for Timaru, around 320km away . Gloriavale residents do not hold celebrations for birthday parties or Christmas . Miracle, the daughter of Neville Cooper (pictured speaking in a previous interview with New Zealand television) said the Ben Canaan family are adapting very well . The Ben Canaans' close supporters have closed ranks around the family, who last month thanked the community for their support and requested privacy in order to 'settle into our new lives' in Timaru. Sources familiar with Gloriavale, such as Miracle - one of Neville Cooper's ten children - discussed the challenges of adjusting to life outside the commune in general terms to Daily Mail Australia. 'There's just a complete struggle in the outside world,' she said, adding that she had 'nothing' when she left but 'managed to get away' from the community 'without too much drama'. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before. 'You know nothing of just normal, everyday stuff - like renting a home, insurance, any of those types of things. 'Often people don't have their birth certificates or bank accounts. They don't even know how to spend money, how to buy things. 'There's birthday parties, Christmas - none of that was practised in the community... It's huge, adapting (to all of that).' The Ben Canaans will now be able to readily access personal technology, like mobile phones and have a television which they can watch without restrictions. Neville Cooper - now known by the name Hopeful Christian - is the Australian evangelist who founded the Gloriavale commune after clashing with church leaders in New Zealand and Australia. In 1995, he spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges . Former Gloriavale residents tend to find it difficult to adapt from the outside world, a former resident told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's totally different to what you've lived before' The Ben Canaans no longer have to wear their Gloriavale 'uniform'. Instead, Miracle said they will now wear 'modest clothes'. The women in the family will also have to adjust to a world where make-up is worn regularly. Author Fleur Beale, who wrote the book Sins of The Father about the 1989 escape of Neville Cooper's son, Phil, and his family from the commune, said the biggest challenge the Ben Canaans would have would be financial, particularly given their 12 children. 'You can imagine what it's like trying to find a place to live with a family like that,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Gloriavale residents are often dubbed 'Cooperites'. Pictured is a Gloriavale wedding . The happy couple kiss as they are led from their wedding ceremony . 'You haven't been used to handling money or buying in a shop. And what do you wear?' The details of the Ben Canaans' departure from Gloriavale remain unclear. Miracle said the community was not surrounded with large walls, but: 'There are different types of walls... 'Psychological walls as well as physical barriers, but no access to telephones and long driveways to be able to leave.' A spokesman for the commune, Fervant Steadfast, told the New Zealand Herald last month the family had been permitted to depart. 'If they want to go and live in Timaru, well, that's their choice and that's what they need to do. 'No one is here against their will. We only want people who want to be here.' Nestled on the banks of the picturesque Lake Haipuri on New Zealand's rugged West Coast, Gloriavale is a Christian community of around 500 people who follow a literal interpretation of the New Testament. The community, which isolates itself from the outside world, was founded by Neville Cooper, a Australian evangelist. Cooper moved across the Tasman in 1969 with his wife, Gloria, and their ten children to found a Christian community. As its membership swelled, in 1991 they purchased land by the scenic lake to live off. Mr Cooper - a controversial figure who spent almost a year in prison on sex abuse charges in 1995 - would later change his name to 'Hopeful Christian'. Fleur Beale, the author of the Gloriavale book Sins of the Father, said the most striking thing about Gloriavale was the 'control those in power' - a group of elders - 'had over the ordinary people.' 'The women, particularly - it would be miserable to be a woman in Gloriavale,' Ms Beale told Daily Mail Australia. Birth control is non-existent. 'God wants you to get married and have as many children as you can. That's why they have big families.' Residents are required to wear a uniform. Women generally frock up in long, blue dresses - 'every single day', a former resident named Miracle told Daily Mail Australia. Meanwhile, men wear neckties, dark blue pants and a light blue sleeved shirt. And while the personal use of technologies such as television and mobile phones is rare among 'ordinary people', Ms Beale said the community was 'very innovative', with extensive commercial operations. Residents do not take any wages, but work hard for the community's dairy and deer farms. The community consists of more than 80 families, according to Gloriavale's official website, and they live together in large, communal hostels.","A New Zealand family of fourteen walked out of remote Christian sect .

The man was located after Operation Resolve launched the appeal on Thursday morning in the hope that the supporters might be able to supply crucial evidence for the ongoing inquest. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy were released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal  is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner’s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed. The Home Secretary Theresa May launched a fresh probe into the disaster the same year. Investigators hope members of the public may recognise some of those pictured in the appeal . While the images are 26 years old, investigators believe they may help track down key witnesses. Above, a man in a dark coloured jacket (left) and another in a beige jacket and grey hooded sweatshirt (right) who police believe may be able to help .

Anyone with information about those pictured is urged to contact Operation Resolve officers . While officers said it was 'unusual' to carry out such appeals as today's while legal proceedings are active they invited anyone who recognised the people photographed to make contact. 'I have a team of highly trained staff in place who will deal with witnesses sensitively as we understand how difficult some people will find this,' added Mr Stoddart. 'The Operation Resolve website also contains useful contacts should members of the public require welfare assistance. 'It is unusual to carry out an appeal of this nature during an ongoing legal process such as the inquests and for that reason I urge people to remember the warning issued by the Coroner at the start of the fresh inquests, which he reiterated in February 2014. 'I also urge people to consider the advisory notice issued by the Attorney General’s office on 10 March 2014. 'It is really important that people do not pass comment on our appeal or any other aspect of the Hillsborough disaster on social media and forums.' Among those to have already given evidence at the inquest in Warrington are the families of those killed and police officers working at the time. The inquest continues.

599fd9403fd6887ac498a13d5ac615ddbe5c3b0c,"(CNN)NASA says its Messenger space probe crashed into Mercury on Thursday after running out of fuel, ending a nearly 11-year journey that provided valuable data and thousands of photos. Mission controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, confirmed the probe slammed into the surface of Mercury, as anticipated, at 3:26 p.m. EDT, NASA told CNN in an email. NASA earlier said the probe was expected to hit the surface at 8,750 miles per hour and to create an impact crater 52 feet (16 meters) in diameter. The crash wasn't visible from Earth because it occurred on the far side of Mercury. Messenger (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) was launched in 2004 and traveled more than 6½ years before it started circling Mercury on March 18, 2011. It was the first spacecraft to orbit the planet closest to the sun. It traveled about 5 billion miles -- a journey that included 15 trips around the sun. Spacecraft to make death dive into Mercury . The spacecraft was healthy when it crashed, but was out of fuel. When scientists determined there was no way to save it, they held a briefing this month to celebrate the mission's success. ""For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,"" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA headquarters in Washington. One of the mission's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. As the end neared, the probe sent back some final tweets thanking mission managers and counting down its final orbits. The Messenger mission is over, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And while the space probe won't be sending back anymore images, you can see Mercury with your own eyes. It's visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May.","NASA's Messenger probe smashes into Mercury, ending mission .

The girls put aside their fear of heights as they paraded along the narrow footpath in red bikinis and black high heels in a 'test of their composure' as part of a Chinese beauty pageant. The challenge was part of the central China stage of the annual Miss Bikini of the Universe contest, which has been running since 2005, according to the People's Daily Online. Don't look down: Models at a beauty pageant look a little unsure as they stand on a glass walkway, 2,000 metres up in Luoyang . Holding on: Many of the models held onto the safety railings as they made their way up the cliff pathway to take part in the competition .

Some models decided to kick off their heels and walk bare-footed to negotiate the potholes. While the girls seemed to enjoy themselves, some Chinese social media users criticised organisers for making them strut along the side of a mountain. One user wrote: 'Who is it that came up with such a bad idea to torture the beauties? It is so windy on the mountains. Try getting your daughter up on the cliff with bikinis on.' The girls were competing to get to the national final in Beijing. It is not the first the time that organisers have pushed their contestants to their limit.

This time, Dai Young has sounded the annual alarm. Wasps’ director of rugby could not have asked much more from his gallant side as they pushed Toulon all the way before losing their Champions Cup quarter-final at Stade Felix Mayol on Sunday. Yet, the scale of what they were up against was illustrated by the sight of Matt Giteau and Juan Fernandez Lobbe – two of the world’s finest players – coming on as replacements for the hosts. A pair of Springboks, Bryan Habana and Juan Smith, were among a glittering non-playing contingent. Wasps coach Dai Young has called for reform to the Premiership salary cap so English clubs can compete on the European stage - the comments came after his team lost 32-18 to Toulon on Sunday . Lozowski makes a diving pass while his ankle is grasped by the Toulon player on the ground . Toulon's English speedster Delon Armitage makes a break for the defending champions . CLERMONT v SARACENS, Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, St Etienne, Saturday, April 18, 3.15pm (GMT) TOULON v LEINSTER, Stade Vélodrome, Marseille, Sunday,     April 19, 3.15pm (GMT) Young quipped that the absence of Leigh Halfpenny from the Toulon ranks meant that Wasps only had ‘about five world-class full-backs to worry about’. The joke hinted at a more serious point; the personnel gulf between the wealthy French elite and their Premiership rivals. The English clubs simply can’t compete when the leading Top 14 sides play to their potential, due to the disparity in budgets. Yet again, the salary cap — currently £5.5million — is back on the agenda. ‘There are pros and cons for everything,’ said Young. ‘The salary cap has worked; all the clubs have been sustainable for a long period, it’s the most competitive league in Europe and there have been two or three different title winners in the last few seasons, too. Wasps' No 10 Alex Lozowski kicks away from Michalak during their European Champions Cup quarter-final . Toulon playmaker Frederic Michalak pulls the strings for the defending European champions . ‘It has also meant a lot of young English players are getting exposure at that level, so it has done what it was intended to do. But maybe we need a a re-think about how important Europe is to the English teams and how the salary cap leaves us when playing against the big French teams. ‘Realistically, Premiership teams need a bit of luck to arrive at these games with their best team fit. With the salary cap, there’s no way we can match the massive squads these clubs have.’ Wasps couldn’t match Toulon’s depth of playing resources, but they did trouble the holders thanks to the dynamic efforts of two young Englishmen — centre Elliot Daly and scrum-half Joe Simpson. Their electric running maintained the form Young believes should put them in contention for a place in England’s World Cup squad. ‘I don’t know what more they can do,’ said the Welshman. ‘If England want to win the World Cup, these are the type of players you have to get in your team.’ New Zealander Williams rises to celebrate his try which came minutes after he should have been sin-binned . Ali Williams crosses for a late try for Toulon as they put victory over Wasps on Sunday beyond doubt .","Dai Young wants to reform the current salary cap in English top flight .

The last tournament before the Masters is proving quite a show-stopper itself thanks to the crowd-pleasing antics of the popular Phil Mickelson and local boy Jordan Spieth. It’s 18 months now since Spieth attracted criticism for giving up on university and joining the PGA Tour as the 809th ranked player in the world. Spieth, only 21, has since risen to number four in the world. Funnily enough, no-one’s criticising him anymore. Spectators have flocked to see Texas local boy Jordan Spieth in action at the Shell Houston Open . Spieth's fellow American Phil Mickelson has also impressed in the run up to the Masters . In seven starts this season Spieth, who finished runner-up on his Masters debut last year, has finished outside the top seven only twice, and here a second-round 66 lifted him to within three shots of the leader, Andrew Putnam. As for Mickelson, he’d hardly played a decent shot this year before posting rounds of 66 and 67 to be one stroke behind at halfway. The stage was set beautifully, therefore, for the two Americans at opposite ends of their careers. Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey were also going well at five shots off the pace.","Record numbers have flocked to see local boy Jordan Spieth in action .

4a978aa7d45a12f7bea11d0c64d643f8a8a13a2d,"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers believes recent defeats are down to his players' own failings rather than the opposition having cracked their system. The Reds' 3-4-2-1 formation, implemented from mid-December, helped produce a 13-match unbeaten Barclays Premier League run which lifted them to within a win of breaking back into the Champions League qualification places. But despite receiving plaudits for the quality of their football, which at times appeared to be unplayable, flaws started to appear a month ago when they were held to a goalless draw by Sky Bet Championship side Blackburn in the FA Cup. Brendan Rodgers says his sides recent defeats are down to his players, not his tactics being susses . After scraping a win against Swansea they were then exposed by Manchester United and Arsenal, two teams already in the top four. However, Rodgers insists a drop-off in results is more to do with their own performances than those of their opponents. 'I don't think it's about being worked out. We didn't start well (against Arsenal), and it doesn't matter what system you are playing if that happens,' he said. 'In the last four games that we've played we haven't created as much, and that's more on ourselves. Liverpool have lost ground in the race for the Champions League places and will find it hard to recover . 'Of course you give opponents credit but every team will go into a game to defend well and work hard against you. 'Probably the Blackburn game when we drew 0-0 and the games following that we haven't created as much. 'That's something that we want to reinforce - the creativity for chances and hopefully taking those chances. 'It's a difficult system to play against, but it's one of a number of systems we've played here and played very well. Alexis Sanchez fires home Arsenal's third goal, as the Gunners thrashed Liverpool at the Emirates . 'It's my job to always look to find the solutions, that's what I've tried to do in the games when we didn't look like scoring, finding a way to win.' Blackburn, who host Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, will take heart from the Merseysiders' mini-slump at a crucial time of the season. For Rodgers and Liverpool though the cup now represents the only chance to save their season and that should guarantee a reaction at Ewood Park. 'It's important to have a game quickly when you lose,' added Rodgers. 'The group is very committed to winning this trophy but in order to do that you have to qualify and we know Blackburn will be a difficult game for us. Steven Gerrard (left) and Mario Balotelli look on as Rodgers give a talk to his players and staff . 'A trophy this season will mark another step forward for us. Getting to a final and winning a trophy is what we want. 'In terms of the FA Cup that was always an objective. 'On Wednesday, we'll look to reach our second semi-final of the season in the cup competitions (having been narrowly beaten by Chelsea over two legs).' With the play-offs out of reach for Rovers they will also be putting all their efforts into trying to reach a Wembley last-four encounter with Aston Villa. Jordan Rhodes (centre) can cause Liverpool's leaky defence a number of problems in the FA Cup replay . They showed enough on Merseyside a month ago to suggest they can trouble the Reds and, having dispatched top-flight sides Swansea and Stoke at Ewood Park, they will have no fear of Liverpool's arrival. 'Blackburn have got some excellent players. They defended well when they came to Anfield,' said Rodgers. 'We'll go there really focused and determined - we can't wait to play again after the weekend's disappointment.'","Brendan Rodgers admitted the recent defeats were down to his players .
